<p>On Monday, our robot was shipped to St. Louis, Missouri for the World Championship next week! We are so pleased to be going and are excited to experience the competition! The team will be leaving early Wednesday morning, April 22, to arrive in time to set up the pits, reassemble the robot and go through robot inspection. We are really looking forward to meeting other teams from around the world. They are coming from places like China, Israel and many other countries and states!</p>
<p>Thursday is the day the matches begin! Qualification matches start at 8:30 am. Friday's qualification rounds start at 8:00 am and teams will be competing until around 6:30 pm. Saturday, the team will have an early start. Division Awards Ceremonies start at 7:30 followed by alliance selections then sub-division playoffs! Championship Matches and Awards are scheduled to commence at 2:30 that afternoon. When not competing, we plan to spend time meeting other teams from around the world! We are thrilled to have qualified for Worlds and we can hardly wait until next week!</p>
