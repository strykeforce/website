# Sponsor Appreciation Open House

Earlier this week we had the pleasure of hosting several of our various sponsors atÂ our sponsor appreciation open house. The sponsors were given the opportunity to meet the team, check out the robot, and receive an update on our highly successful season. This season would not have been possible without the support of all of our amazing sponsors. We had a great time showing off our robot and letting the sponsors know how much we appreciate them!
