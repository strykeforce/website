<p>Next week, Wednesday April 7, the Stryke Force team will be traveling to Grand Rapids to compete in the State Competition, at the Delta Plex until Saturday April, 11. We have been doing many things to prepare for the competition! The team began practicing and making modifications as soon as we returned from the St. Joe district competition. Over the past 2 weeks, we have been hard at work. The build and programming teams tuned up the robot to go as fast as it can. We built new arms and  double levers were added to hold the totes more securely. The robot can now hold a stack of 5 totes instead of just 4 totes. Long extensions were added to the top of the robot to help stabilize the bin when carrying stacks. The programming and build teams are working together to be able to grab totes from the step, during the autonomous period, and to be the fastest at doing so, which would give us a huge advantage.</p>
<p>The Business Team has also been working hard to prepare for States. We have written and revised the presentation that we will be giving at the competition, along with an essay and video for the Engineering Inspiration Award. 18 teams in the state have won the award at the district events and are now given the opportunity to present to a panel of judges at the state competition. Only one team will win the award at the state level, which will give them an automatic qualification to the World Competition.</p>
