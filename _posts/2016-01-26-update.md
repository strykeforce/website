<p>With just 6 short weeks to build the robot, the build team has been working nonstop. At first, students focused on strategies and design options. Next,  students broke into groups to work on prototypes for the different design ideas. Also, some of the programmers on our team have been working on the scouting system for this year's game. At the same time, people are hard at work building the tower and defenses for our practice field. Due to this, students have the chance to work with wood, in addition to the metal for the robot. The chassis has been built and we were able to practice driving it. We are approaching the halfway mark for the building opportunities, and are working hard having fun while bringing our ideas to reality.</p>
