With the beginning of school the FRC and FTC summer adventures have ended! Robin Hood and the FTC robot have returned to Midlink for the start of the 2016-2017 season. The FTC and FRC students are back in school and our alumni have headed off to college. Just because summer is done doesn't mean that the fun is over! The FTC students are super excited for their game reveal this Saturday! The FRC team will begin getting Robin Hood ready for the WMRI on October 29th. The students are also excited for the pre-season classes the mentors will be teaching to get everyone ready for the FRC kickoff on January 7th.
