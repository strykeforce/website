<p>As the 2015 season is drawing to a close it’s time to begin saying goodbye to our wonderful seniors. We’ll miss you all more than words can express, and we wish you the very best wherever life takes you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gabe Daudert</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I plan to obtain my associates at KVCC and then transfer to a larger school to go for a masters. Currently I am considering either WMU or Cornerstone. I would like to get a degree in Computer Information Systems. I've had a great time on the team these past three years. Being a driver this year was especially fun. The pressure was definitely worth the reward of a good match.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chloê Mendez</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Being involved with many aspects of the team has made my time on the team very enjoyable. From programming, to working on the website, to running the scouting system, I've really enjoyed my experience on the team. A particular memory I have enjoyed is watching the game of capture the flag at the team party, which always devolves into who can hit each other with pool noodle swords the most. Next year, I will be studying electrical engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
