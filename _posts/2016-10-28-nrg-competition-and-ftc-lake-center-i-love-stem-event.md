# NRG Competition and FTC Lake Center I LOVE STEM Event!

Several of our students on the FTC team participated in the I LOVE STEM event at Lake Center Elementary School this past Thursday.  The students talked about their team, helped guests drive the robot, and celebrated the STEM opportunities available in our community.  It was  wonderful event, and the students were proud to be a part of it! The NRG competition was a brand new program for us this year. We had five participants, two fourth graders and three fifth graders, all of built amazing robots that swept the audience away. The program was run by a one of our own FRC alumnus, Taylor Bruinwood.  A team of FRC students and mentors met over the summer to create a rule book and game for the students.  The students started with an arduino robot and built their parts to play the game, and this year everyone built their own unique type of bulldozer.  Six weeks were spent tinkering on the robots and then the students got to enjoy a competition night cheered on by the older program students, family, and friends! Congratulations NRG Students for a great season!! ![stem-1](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/STEM-1-300x169.jpg) ![stem-2](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/STEM-2-300x169.jpg) ![nrg](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NRG-300x169.png) ![nrg2](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NRG2-300x168.png)
