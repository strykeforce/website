For the past three years Midlink Business Park has graciously donated space for our team to build in. Recently they installed overhead garage doors, which means Stryke Force is moving over! Although we didn't go far, we had to move the full size FRC field, FTC field, and quonset hut, as well as all of our work tables, toolboxes, machines, and tools. It was a large task that was not expected to be finished in just one evening. Last night students, mentors, and parents came together and successfully moved everything in one meeting! Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make this happen!!
