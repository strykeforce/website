<p>What a whirlwind of a weekend!</p>
<p>The FTC kids finished their competition in Des Moines.  They were amazing.  They bounced around in the rankings finishing 14<sup>th</sup> in their division of 36.</p>
<p>They worked together as a team through adversity and triumph.  Every one of the students worked hard at their jobs to ensure a prepared robot was a contender in each match.</p>
<p>Great friendships were made with each other and other Michigan teams.  Plans are in the making for a giant party at the end of the season with two of these teams.</p>
<p>These students are proof that hard work and fun can work together to build a quality team, robot and ultimately a better world.</p>
<p>The FTC league will miss some great students next year as Jack, Ross, Sierra, and Zach move up to FRC.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your support throughout their season.</p>
