On June 12th members of the Stryke Force business team met with their mentor Kay Palan, Dean of the Haworth Business College, to discuss updating the business plan. The business plan is a living document which catalogs the teamâ€™s accomplishments, goals, and current information. Each year team numbers (both student numbers and number of schools we recruit from), awards, and sponsors must be updated. In the business plan we also accommodate for a contingency plan in case of future troubles, this serves as troubleshooting in advance. We include information about fundraising, recruiting , and raising awareness for STEM in the Kalmazoo Area. Every year the business plan expands as the team expands, the more thorough the business plan the better! This document serves as a very important basis for the team and helps the team as a whole to be successful! It really puts into perspective how much work it takes to make Stryke Force a success!
