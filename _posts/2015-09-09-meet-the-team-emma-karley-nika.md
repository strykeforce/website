What are you looking forward to this year: Our team bond was great by the end of the season, in the following year I can't wait for it to get even better. Next year I'll show off even more killer dance moves!   **![IMG_20150908_091128](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_20150908_091128-300x300.jpg)Karley R.** Junior Kalamazoo Central Build Team 2nd year on Stryke Force         Favorite team memory: Although it may not have been funny at the time, I look back on it with humor. At one of the competitions we smashed our battery with another team's vice grip. What are you looking forward to this year: I look forward to learning even more than I did last year!   **![IMG_20150908_090912](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_20150908_090912-300x300.jpg)Nika B.** Junior Portage Central Programming Team 2nd year on Stryke Force         Favorite team memory: My favorite memory from last year was when we did so well at States that we earned our way to Worlds.
