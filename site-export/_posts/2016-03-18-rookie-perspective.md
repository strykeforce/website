<p>The first Stryke Force competition you go to is always awe-inspiring. In order to grasp how spectacular the St. Joe competition was for some of the new recruits, I interviewed a tenth grader who is new on the team this year; Erich.</p>
<p><a href="http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_07071.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3227"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3227" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_07071.jpg" alt="IMG_0707" width="501" height="743" /></a></p>
<p>In three words, describe your experience at St. Joe.- I've got to go with awesome, interesting, and, well, REALLY awesome!</p>
<p>What was your favorite part? - That's a tough one, I guess I'd say I enjoyed watching our robot actually do something and seeing the effects of our hard work pay off as the points went up.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to for the rest of the season.- Seeing more of other team's designs, there are some really good ideas out there and I can't wait to see them. I like knowing that everyone did things a different, interesting way.</p>
