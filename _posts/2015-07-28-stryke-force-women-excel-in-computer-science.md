<p>Perhaps the most famous innovators of the computer industry include Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates. Because of this, computer scientists are typically stereotyped as being male. However, not many people are aware of the important female scientists that helped advance the computer industry, such as Grace Hopper. The women on the Stryke Force robotics team further seek to challenge this stereotype by becoming competent computer scientists themselves. From July 4th to July 10th, Styke Force team members Lena Wood, Nika Buss, and Lizzie Kimmel attended the Women in Computer Science residential summer youth program at Michigan Technological University. There, they enhanced their programming knowledge by learning to program in MIT app inventor, a software development platform used to create apps for Android phones. The young women also experimented with 2-d and 3-d modeling, using processing, a java-based 2-d modeling programming language, and google Sketch-up, which is used for designing houses and other objects. While on campus, the students also had the opportunity to speak with women currently employed in the computer science industry, at companies such as Amazon, Netflix, and Google. Students also had the pleasure of being taught by Dr. Linda Ott, a faculty member of Michigan Tech, and a founding member of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Michigan Affiliate Award for high school women. Within one week, the Stryke Force women were able to deeply explore the field of computing, which will hopefully be present throughout the rest of their lives.</p>
