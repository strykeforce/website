<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; widows: auto;">Did you see any yellow Stryke Force shirts in your area last night?  The FTC kids were out in full force collecting returnables for their Pop Can Drive.  It was a great opportunity for them to practice their people skills while taking an active part in raising money for the team.  Watching some of the less outgoing team members psyching themselves up to ring a doorbell and then coming through with their pitch was something great to see.  Going out and talking to people even got them a few potential leads for mentors and team members!  As a fundraiser, it was a huge success.  Even with some bottles and cans left to return, the kids have exceeded their goal.  The season is off to a great start - only 17 more days until Kickoff!</span></p>
