<p>On Thursday, November 5, one of the business team students, Emma, presented to the Gull Lake Rotary Club. Emma spoke to the club about what FIRST is, and told them more about our team. Students from the build, business, and FTC teams went along to speak about their personal experiences, as well as help show off the robots. There’s nothing our team loves more than to share our passions with others!</p>
