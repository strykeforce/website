# FTC Scrimmage

Last Sunday, the Stryke Force FTC Teams were excited to welcome the Tech Vikes from Hopkins Michigan to Midlink for a Scrimmage. It is always fun to get together with other FTC teams. This gave our teams a chance to practice driving and for our rookies to see what a field looks like with more than one robot. We learned a lot and had a great time.
