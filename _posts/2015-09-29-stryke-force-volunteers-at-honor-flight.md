# Stryke Force Volunteers At Honor Flight

This Saturday, Â a bunch of Stryke Force members came together at the air zoo in order to participate in the 2015 Honor Flight. This organization raises money to send war veterans to Washington D.C. to view their memorials. Our part is to welcome them back home when their plane arrives. Personally, I thought that the whole thing was phenomenal! At first there was a lot of waiting around and organizing, but even that was fun. It was a great chance for the FTC (middle school) and FRC (high school) teams to hang out and get to know each other more. It was also a great way to learn skills such as being civil and polite when giving directions, and helping others.

### Then, the main event, the veterans arrived!

It was incredible to see them form a sort of parade and walk to the door surrounded by cheering people of all ages, who wanted to thank them for everything they've done for this country. Stryke Force was right there cheering with the best of them. My favorite part was listening to some of the stories the veterans told us. It felt great to learn things and see events in a perspective I had never been exposed to before. Anyway, it was amazing, thanks to all of you who came and helped us celebrate.
