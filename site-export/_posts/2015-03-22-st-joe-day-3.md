<p>We had such an amazing weekend!! A huge thank you to our mentors, sponsors, parents and all of our awesome fans! We would not have been able to compete this weekend with all of your endless support!!</p>
<p>We had the high score in all three of our qualification matches this morning, putting us in 6th place at the beginning of the alliance selections. During the selection process we moved up to the 5th seed alliance captain. We added team 5069, and team 4325 to our alliance and headed into the quarterfinals!</p>
<p>We advanced through the quarterfinals with the high score in both of our matches! After some very close matches in the semifinals, we sadly did not advance on to the finals.</p>
<p>But that was not the end of the competition! After the finals matches finished, it was time for the awards ceremony. And, drum roll please, we won the Engineering Inspiration Award!!! Â This is the second most prestigious award at the competition. Thank you to everyone who helped make winning this award possible!!</p>
<p>We won't find out for sure if we go the State competition until a couple of weeks. So stayed tuned to find out what's next for the team. Go Stryke Force!!</p>
