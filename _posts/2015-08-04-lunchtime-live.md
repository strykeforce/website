# Lunchtime Live!

Food trucks, live music, and robots?

On Friday, July 31, the students of Stryke Force enjoyed their afternoon at Bronson Park during Lunchtime Live. It was a beautiful day and could not have been any better. With the many people who had come down to the park to enjoy food, it was the perfect location to set up a table and introduce Stryke Force and our robots to new faces. As our robot Maverick was in use, it attracted many young kids and adults to see what it was all about. The younger kids absolutely loved playing catch with Maverick and would do it over and over again. The fun never seemed to stop! We also had many business men and women who stopped by on their lunch break to ask about the program, even Bobby Hopewell stopped by for a quick chat. As well as informing the public about our team, we also had lots of fun and laughs. From the food in the food trucks to the kids playing with Maverick, everyone had an amazing time!
