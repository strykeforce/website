# Kalamazoo County Fair (4-H Fair)

During the Kalamazoo County Fair, Stryke Force set up our pit in the show case area for the 4-H section.  If you stopped by and couldn't find our team members, then we were at the Food Booth! Stryke Force members and mentors might of been hot and sticky, but the food that they served were was refreshing.  Many students participated in manning the food booth and dished out some fabulous ice cream sundaes and walking tacos!  The display looked fantastic this year with posters of the robot flying through the air hanging.
