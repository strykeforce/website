<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day two of the State Championship was fantastic!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team performed wonderfully today. The pit crew kept the robot running throughout the heat of the competition. Our amazing scouters worked hard gathering information for the alliance selection on Saturday. The drive team drove flawlessly, winning all four of the matches we played today!</span></p>
