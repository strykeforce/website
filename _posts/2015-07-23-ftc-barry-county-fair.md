# FTC Barry County Fair

On Wednesday, the Stryke Force FTC team had the opportunity to compete in a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robotics competition at the Barry County Fair.  Our goal was to build and program a robot to travel through the course and perform a number of tasks.  It was a tough challenge, and we learned a lot.  As a bonus, we got to experience the bird encounter, ride some rides, and enjoy some good food.   While we didn’t win, we had a great time at the fair! ![Stryke Force FTC Barry County Fair \(15\)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stryke-Force-FTC-Barry-County-Fair-15-1024x683.jpg) ![Stryke Force FTC Barry County Fair \(17\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stryke-Force-FTC-Barry-County-Fair-17-1024x683.jpg) ![Stryke Force FTC Barry County Fair \(29\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stryke-Force-FTC-Barry-County-Fair-29-1024x717.jpg) ![Stryke Force FTC Barry County Fair \(23\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stryke-Force-FTC-Barry-County-Fair-23-1024x576.jpg)
