# Student Perspective - Ashley

Check out what one of our rookie students has to say about her experience with Stryke Force.

As it is my first year on Stryke Force, I lack memories to share with prospective team members. However, I won't hesitate to share that most team members and all mentors are extremely willing to share their knowledge with anybody who asks. My experience with the mentors has been one of my favorite things this year because I can be confident that my questions will be well received and that I will be capable of contributing something worthwhile to the robot - a huge concern for new teammates.

For me, robotics is a whole new can of worms, so to speak. I'm a KAMSC junior, so I have some background in computer programming and hardware, but perhaps not enough to fully design a robot. Student expectations play a huge role in the work environment (and maybe self esteem) for those who expect to contribute a lot to whatever project they take on. Thus far, it seems as though anybody with a little bit of computer science knowledge can pick up enough information from the mentors to complete a task and understand the science or mechanics behind it.

The season hasn't even started yet and I've already had a fun experience with an allen wrench. If you don't know what that is, it's a hexagonal strip of metal that goes into a screw, so that the apparatus won't spin when you try to remove the nut. The reason I share this is because I didn't know what it was either until after using it and many, many laughs. As I've already expressed, Stryke Force is a great learning environment where those who want to contribute can be taught how to get a job done right.

I think everybody should be on a team at some point. If sports aren't your thing, robotics is a good place to start. KAMSC has granted me a misconception: robotics seems like the sort of thing where you can't REALLY work as a team, such that a few people control the operation and others are left to float through. In reality, there is enough to do around the robots that all team members support those who want to help.
