<div>With the excitement about State and World competitions, here's a reminder on some of the long-lasting benefits of Stryke Force Robotics. Katherine Rothe is a Stryke Force alumni currently at Purdue University for the second year. Here are some answers  Katherine had to questions posed.</div>

<div>1. How do you feel that Stryke Force has prepared you for life outside of high school?</div>
<div>Stryke Force taught me a lot about life outside school, and one of the most important things I learned was how to work on a team. There isn't a lot of that in high school, but as an engineering major in college, teamwork is very important. Stryke Force gave me the resources and experience to know my own strengths both on and off a team, and how to work best with other people.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Looking back, how did Stryke Force influence/change you as a person?</div>
<div>Stryke Force was a great influence on me as a person. Being involved in robotics helped me find my passion for engineering, and also let me discover a lot about myself in the process. I also believe that mentoring the FTC teams taught me quite a bit about how much I enjoy helping others learn - that's part of the reason I became a TA.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3. What is one of your favorite memories of Stryke Force?</div>
<div>One of my favorite Stryke Force memories (besides winning Niles during Rebound Rumble) was seeing the robot drive for the first time after weeks of building and programming it. I will never forget the excitement of seeing something that I had helped build move and operate the way we wanted it to.</div>
