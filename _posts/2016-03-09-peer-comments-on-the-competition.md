For the people who haven't been to a FIRST robotics competition before, this weekend will be an exciting yet slightly intimidating process, to help you have the best experience possible, some of the older Stryke Force members have composed a list of advice.

Mckenzie: Enjoy the music

Nika: Dancing makes it more fun. Also, it might be kinda cold in the morning but it gets REALLY hot in the afternoon, especially in the pits.

Sierra: Sleep, without a good night's rest, you'll probably be a lot more irritable and the competition takes a lot of energy. Oh, and make friends, meet new people!

Garret: Be appropriate, this is no time to act childish. For example, if the mentors are busy, don't bother them, just come back later.

Taylor: Participate and be helpful, don't just sit around.

Kelsey: Eat food, drink water, dance like you mean it, repeat.

Mentor Doug Staunton:  Be helpful to everyone, both your own team and other teams.

Jack: Don't turn on your own team if things go wrong. It's nobody's fault, just fix the problem and move on.

Lucas: Be prepared to cheer and dance... a lot.
