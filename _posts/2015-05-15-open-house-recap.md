# Open House Recap

We had an amazing turnout for the open houses this week! Both Highschool FRC and Middle School FTC teams had a large number of students interested in becoming a Stryke Force member! Interested students were given the opportunity to tour the build space, talk to members of the build, business, and programming teams, to drive the FTC and the FRC robots! We're very excited that so many students are interested in what we love, and we can't wait for our Stryke Force Family to keep growing! If you were unable to make it to any of the open houses this week, but still have an interest in joining, you can contact us by using the "contact" tab and the link under that tab, labeled "new students" on the main menu of the website. ![IMG_0074](/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_00741-300x225.jpg) Â  ![IMG_0050](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0050-300x225.jpg)
