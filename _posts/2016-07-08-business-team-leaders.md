I am a senior at Gull Lake High School and this will be my third year on the team. I will be taking over this position from Kelsey Bruinwood who will be a freshman at Calvin College this coming fall. She has done an excellent job and definitely leaves an inspiring legacy behind!  This position is not a responsibility to be taken lightly, and it is one that will require a lot of trial and error to be successful in. However with the guidance of my mentors and the many resources left behind by Kelsey I feel confident that it is more than possible to achieve success.  I will not be working alone, Mariana Bringaas will be my Vice Student Business Leader. She will be a senior at Portage Central High School and it will be her second year on the team next year. The two of us work very well together and will work as a team in the coming season.  In the coming year we are working to involve more build students in the business aspects of the team, and more business kids in the build aspects. This will further students learning of the importance of the symbiotic relationship between build and business.  Both Mariana and I are extremely excited for the coming 2016-2017 season!
