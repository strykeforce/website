<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Block ‘N’ Roll occurs on a 12 foot by 8 foot field with four robots playing at once. The field will be divided into two side, both having a scoring pit, and a neutral zone in the middle. The object of the game is to push as many blocks and balls into your scoring pit, accumulating points! The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. There will be a 2 minute Driver controlled period during which teams work together to score cubes. The last 30 seconds involve robots having to venture into the opposing team’s side and extract a ring, pushing it back to their own scoring tape. Additional points can be score with this final challenge and the use of teamwork.</span></p>
