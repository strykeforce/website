<p>On Monday, May 11, Tuesday, May 12, and Wednesday, May 13, we are hosting new student open houses for any high school and/or middle school students interested in joining the Stryke Force FIRST Robotics Team. The open houses will run from 5:30-7:30 pm, and they will be hosted at our practice space, in Midlink Business Park. We are located at 5200 East Cork Street, Kalamazoo, MI 49048, which is on the South East corner of Sprinkle Rd. and highway 131. Â It is open to all students wanting to know more about who we are and what we do. Whether you are looking at Engineering, Business, or Programming, all are welcome to come. We will have the robot up and running, and prospective new members will have a chance to drive the robot on our field! If you have trouble finding the space, you can leave your name, email and comment under our "Contact" tab on our website.</p>
<p>*As a heads up, the Sprinkle Road exit is closed due to construction</p>
