Hi, my name is Drew Stark and I will be taking over all social media facets for Stryke Force this year! I am currently a senior at Gull Lake High School and KAMSC. While this is my first and sadly last year on the team, I have been a part of FIRST for six years; doing everything from Programming, CAD, and Strategy. Along with this job, I will also be a part of the Build Team. The task of keeping the public updated with all of our exploits throughout the year is a big one, but I can't tell you how excited I am for the challenge. This year, the business team and the build team have become more integrated than ever, allowing for more glimpses into the wild world of 2767 Stryke Force Robotics. So make sure to keep yourself updated through the season using any of the social media sites managed by me; Facebook, Wordpress, Instagram, and Twitter.
