<p>Our second day at Worlds was another amazing experience for the team! Although we faced difficulties throughout the day, we persevered and ran a successful autonomous all day.Â Throughout the day we talked with judges, as well as other teams, and showed off what Stryke Force has accomplished. We bounced around in our rankings, ending the day in 24th place.</p>
<p>Although we have been working together since September, Worlds has proven to be a great opportunity for team bonding. From riding to and from the venue on the train, to sight seeing at the City Garden, to visiting the Junior FIRST Lego Leauge (JrFLL), we are creating memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>A couple of our FTC students came with us to Worlds, today they were able to meet with their good friends, Hexasonics, to show their support. Jack was also able to participate at the Innovation Faire by programming a Mindstorm to drive through a maze.</p>
<p>We finished the day with a team dinner and unwavering spirit, because we are at Worlds and that is something anyone associated with Stryke Force should be very proud of. Success is a team effort after all!</p>
