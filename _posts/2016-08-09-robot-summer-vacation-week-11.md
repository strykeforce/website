<p>Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with.</p>
<p>Excited by the Olympics, Robin Hood asked Audrey to teach him some tennis. Maybe they'll play together in the 2020 Olympic games!</p>
