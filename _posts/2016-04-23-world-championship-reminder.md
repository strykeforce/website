<p>The whole team is buzzing with excitement over the upcoming World's championship. We qualified for it in the State competition, in the twenty-seven years of FIRST robotics, we are the second team to ever go undefeated in the qualifying matches, ranking us as 10th in Michigan and making us all the more happy about going to Worlds. This event will start on Wednesday April 27th and go through Saturday April 30th. Taking place in St. Louis, Missouri, it promises to be a fun and fantastic event that all are welcome to.</p>
