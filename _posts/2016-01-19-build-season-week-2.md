<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the off-season last summer and fall our mentors worked hard to prepare us with all the knowledge we would need for the 2016 season. Now that we’re in week 2 of the build season we’re seeing these lesson truly pay off. Already knowing how to use tools such as the drill press and bandsaw saves us valuable time during the short 6 week build period. Some of the students learned CAD (Computer Animated Design) last fall and are now using it to design the robot. Basic terminology that was taught in the off-season is benefiting both rookie and veteran students. Once again, we can’t thank our mentors enough for all of the hard work they put in to teach us everything we need to know.</span></p>
