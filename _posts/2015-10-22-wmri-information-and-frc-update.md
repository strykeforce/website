The WMRI, or West Michigan Robot Invitational is just around the bend! It's coming up October 24th, from 8:30 to 5:30 at Zeeland High School. This event gives our team the chance to become accustomed to the competition environment without the stress of a real robotics competition. The FRC team uses last year's robot to compete in last year's game with 32 other teams in the area. The event is run similar to a real competition, with a few changes to make it run faster. It promises to be an exciting chance to showcase the team's robotics skills and is fun for the current team members, team veterans, and anyone else who wants to show up!

With all the anticipation towards the FTC competition, it's important to remember that us high school kids are working hard as well. So far, Â the FRC team held a driver test to see who would make the best driver for this year's season. We have been mentoring FTC students and passing on our knowledge. The business team has been seeking sponsors to support the team, and, of course, everyone is reviewing the technique and preparing for the WMRI, which, I may have already mentioned, will take place on October 24th! Be sure to come and support our team!
