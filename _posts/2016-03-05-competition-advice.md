Yesterday's meeting included a list of competition guidelines that students should follow, here is a brief summary of the instructions given. Those marked with an aster-ix apply to other visitors as well, not just students.

  1. Close toed shoes are needed, they are mandatory to be in the pits, and recommended throughout the competition.*
  2. Bring your own safety glasses, preferably the cheap ones because they may get lost/broken.
  3. Be kind and courteous to everyone! Mentors, other teams, judges, other team members, etc.
  4. On Friday, arrive punctually or early, seats are limited and Stryke Force wants to get as much room as possible.*
  5. Drink water, stay hydrated
  6. Sarah Milam has set up an awesome scouting program, if you are interested in helping out, Sarah is chief.
  7. In the pits, answer the judges questions to the best of your ability, or defer them to someone else. Never say the forbidden terms "I don't know" or "s/he is wrong."
  8. Last but not least, have fun, this may be a competition, but it's also a chance to hang out with your friends and enjoy yourself!
