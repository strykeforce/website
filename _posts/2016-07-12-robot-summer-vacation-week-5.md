# Robot Summer Vacation - Week 5

Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with. In the spirit of Stronghold Karley taught Robin Hood some archery. Robin Hood made his namesake proud, shooting arrows as well as he shoots boulders.
