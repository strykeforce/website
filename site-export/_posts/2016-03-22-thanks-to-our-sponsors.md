<p>With the wonderful success of St. Joe behind us and the optimistic prospects of Kentwood coming up, Stryke Force has all in all been having an amazing season this year. This success has come from many factors, the hard work of our team, the helpful guidance of our mentors, and, perhaps most importantly, the support given to us by our sponsors. Here's a brief reminder of everything our sponsors have done for us.</p>
<p>Our two main sponsors-</p>
<p><a href="http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/STRYKER_lg.jpg-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1107"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1107" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/STRYKER_lg.jpg-1.jpg" alt="STRYKER_lg.jpg (1)" width="1802" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>Stryker- Stryker has been our valued sponsor for seven years, not only do they give us economical compensation, they also provide a steady stream of mentors, materials, and support for our team.</p>

<p>Midlink- Midlink has been our sponsor for five years. Without Midlink, we'd very likely be building in a team member's garage somewhere. We thank Midlink for giving us our lovely build-space, being very helpful as both our resources and our team grow in numbers.</p>
