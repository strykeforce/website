# Robot Summer Vacation - Week 7

Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with. No competition is complete without some dancing! Kelsey taught Robin Hood some ballet to improve his line dancing skills. Maybe next week Robin Hood will teach the rest of the team Cotton Eye Joe, Cupid Shuffle, and the YMCA!
