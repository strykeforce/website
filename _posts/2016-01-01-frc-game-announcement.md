Happy New Year everybody! To start off this wonderful 2016, the FRC team is preparing for the game announcement on January 9. For this event, students, mentors, parents, and alumni will gather together as the new game is released to the whole world at exactly 10:30. This will come in the form of a video describing the game, as well as online write-ups of the rules and regulations FIRST FRC members will have to follow.

After watching the game description video several times, the rest of the day will be devoted to making strategies and ideas. The team will also get a chance to bond in preparation for all the quality work time that will occur in the future. We are all looking forward to the game reveal and the following 2016 FRC season!
