<p>Today was our first day of competition and it was quite the day! We won our first match as well as the second match. Our human player Paul, has mastered the art of throwing "litter" onto the opposing side of the field, giving us advantages in points!  The team participated in all aspects of the competition, such as dancing, mascots, scouting, and meeting other teams...... making this a very successful first day out on the field.</p>
<p>We gave our presentation for the Chairmans Award in front of the judges this afternoon.  This is the first season Stryke Force has submitted in this category.  Tune in at the end of competition tomorrow and see how things turn out.</p>
<p>Stryke Force would like to thank today's team lunch sponsor, Cornerstone Construction Management.</p>
<p>Tomorrow opening ceremonies begin at 9AM, and the awards begin around 5PM after the last match. Hope to see you all there.</p>
