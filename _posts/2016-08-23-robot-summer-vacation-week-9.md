# Robot Summer Vacation - Week 11

Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with. McKenzie taught Robin Hood how to play lacrosse! He learned that his arm makes a great lacrosse stick if they play with the boulders! Who knows what other hidden talents Robin Hood might have?
