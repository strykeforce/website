# FTC Kentwood Competition

The FTC kids rocked out in the Kentwood competition this weekend! After a strong start, both of the Stryke Force FTC teams climbed their way to the top, ending the qualifying matches with team 7228 in the first ranking and 8553 right behind them in second. For alliances, 7228 picked team 5980, the Tech Vikes and 5391-Enigma, 8553 chose the other Tech Vikes team, 6283, and 6043, NC gears. Semifinals narrowed the competition down until finals matched the 7228 and 8553 teams against each other. The first win went to 7228, the second went to 8553, and in an exciting tie-breaking round, 7228 won the competition. In addition to this, 7228 won the Inspire award, the most prestigious award available to FTC teams. With all these achievements, 7228 and 8553 have both gained places for themselves in the next level of competitions; states.

Their passion and support for each other was obvious to any observer, and the whole competition was a blast!
