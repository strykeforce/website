In response to the West Michigan Robot Invitational a rookie Stryke Force member comments that, "It went well and was very organized. My favorite part was definitely seeing the team come together to cheer the robots on. My favorite part (other than winning) was being able to have that great experience as the new member." It is gratifying to see the effect the practice competition had on the whole team, watching them grow even more excited about the upcoming high school season. ![Capture 3](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture-3.png) **Mini Makers Faire** \- November 6th 6pm-9pm, November 7th 2pm-5pm - Barnes and Noble in Portage **FTC Kentwood Qualifier Competition** \- November 21st 8am-5pm - East Kentwood High School **Kalamazoo Tree Lighting Ceremony** \- November 27th time TBA - Bronson Park
