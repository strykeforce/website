<p>Saturday morning brought heaping excitement as Stryke Force clung to first ranking. In the end, Stryke Force became the first seed alliance captain, our alliance included the second ranking team, 3620 the Average Joes, and 5069 the Iron Giants.</p>
<p><a href="http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/100_0780.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3573"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3573" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/100_0780.jpg" alt="100_0780" width="4000" height="2664" /></a></p>
<p>In quarter finals we lost the first round due to a programming error on our alliance, but won the next two, moving on to semi-finals. We won both rounds of semi-finals winning our highest score of the weekend (174) during the first semifinal match. Then we won the first finals match with a score of 137 to 131 and the second match with 134 to 103. In addition to being the winners, we also received the quality award for the exemplary quality of our team and robot. All in all it was an excellent compitition. We look forward to a couple weeks of refining the robot, then it's on to the Kentwood competition.</p>
