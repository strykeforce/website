Samuel Rabick, one of FTC's programmers, says that "The coding is coming along. We are getting more and more used to the Java software." Lexi, who practiced driving for the FTC team, said that, "Driving the robot is a lot harder than it looks!" Â And when it comes to an adult viewpoint, Coach Missy, one of FTC's amazing coaches, reports that "We're starting the really fun part of the season now, where we can see the progression of our ideas into a working robot." Although, it has been a definite learning process for the middle school team, they are getting a lot done and having fun while they do. Advancements are being made in all of the aspects of the robot, from programming it to driving it.</p>
