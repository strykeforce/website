<p>Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with.</p>
<p>Ross taught Robin Hood how to play soccer! Does anyone remember when another Stryke Force robot played soccer?</p>
