<p>The 2016 season was Stryke Force's second year submitting for the prestigious Chairman's Award. Although we didn't win, we received great feedback from the judges. Our team is going through the pros and cons of this year's submission and planning an even better submission for next season! As always, we will continue impacting as many lives as possible by spreading FIRST into our community.</p>
