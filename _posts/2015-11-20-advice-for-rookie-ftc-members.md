Our FTC teams are super excited for their first competition tomorrow, November 21! Come and cheer them on at East Kentwood High School, Opening Ceremonies will begin at 10:30am! Go [here](http://www.firstinmichigan.org/ftc/FTC_2015/west_mi.html) for more details about the event. We asked current FTC students, and FTC alumni, to share advice they have for the rookie students at the competition:

  * Stay hydrated!!  
  * Listen closely to the instructions. Whether it’s from your own coach and mentors, or from the volunteers working at the event.
  * Be kind and respectful to everyone.
  * Talk with other teams and make friends with the other students. Ask someone from another team about their robot, and tell them something about yours.
  * Be prepared for mishaps, not everything is going to run smoothly the whole time.
  * Stay supportive of your team. Even if you have a bad match, cheer with your team, tell the drive team they did a great job, give each other high fives!
  * Remember that the judges may be watching you throughout the day.  Act in a way that would that would make your team proud!
  * Stand by ready to help if things go wrong.
  * Feel proud of your accomplishments, no matter if you win or not!
  * Dance! Just do it!
  * Most importantly… Have fun!!
