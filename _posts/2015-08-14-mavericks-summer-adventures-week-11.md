# Maverick's Summer Adventures - Week 11

Maverick went to the library to check out some books on STEM. Can you guess what library he's at? Comment your guess and check in [next week](/2015/08/21/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-12/) to see if you were correct! This summer Maverick is going on vacation to tour Kalamazoo with his Stryke Force friends. We'll be posting pictures of his adventures each week, so be sure to look for them!
