# Chairman's Submission 2015

This past year Stryke Force submitted for the Chairman's award for the first time in our seven years as a team. The Chairman's award is the most prestigious award at_ FIRST_, it honors the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the purpose and goals of _FIRST_. Both the Stryke Force business team and the build team collaborated to write a 10,000 character essay, as well as an executive summary which included 12 short essays, each 500 characters . A team of three students consisting of build and business students presented to the judges at the competitions. Lastly, we created a 3 minute video, which you can watch below. Working on this award was very rewarding, having build and business students working side by side for a common goal, and acknowledging that _FIRST_ is much more than just building robots. We may not have won the award this year, but that won't slow us down. We have gained a lot of knowledge this past season and we are working hard to come back with an even stronger submission in 2016! Until then, we will continue doing what we do best, reaching out and volunteering in our community, and inspiring STEM in all those around us. [embed]https://youtu.be/X7clLsMvFC8[/embed]
