Friday's round of competitions was a huge success! We started out strong and didn't lose a match the entire day. Our scouting program was performed seamlessly and we have a good amount of options in mind for alliance partners. Members of tbe build and businesses team spoke with the judges in the pit, showing off our robot and sharing details about our team. The business team carried out their presentation to the judges for the chairman's award excellently. We finished the evening in 1st place with much excitement for tomorrow's matches. ![100_0752](/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/100_0752.jpg) Tomorrow will bring a continuation of preliminary competitions in the morning, with the first eight teams and their alliances to be announced and decided just before lunch. After lunch the rounds of semi-finals and finals will begin. We can only hope for another fun, productive day like today. **Coming Up:** **East Kentwood Competition:** April 1st & 2nd **States Competition:** April 14th, 15th, & 16th
