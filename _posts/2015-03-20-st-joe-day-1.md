Today the team traveled to St. Joseph for our second competition of the year. We're off to a great start as we gear up for the weekend! When we arrived at the venue we unpacked the trailer and proceeded to set up the pit. After passing the robot inspection it was off to practice! We ran numerous practice matches, because as they say, practice makes perfect! Our business student also took care of their marketing jobs, putting up the banners, setting out buttons, and preparing the judges pamphlets. It's going to be a great weekend, so come and cheer with us!
