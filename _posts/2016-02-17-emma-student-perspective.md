All of the students on the Stryke Force Team are buzzing with anticipation as the competitions come up. Here is Emma Scheller's, a business team member and two year student, perspective on what we've been working on. "Going into my second year on Stryke Force, I am more excited than ever to be a part of the coming season. As a member of the business team, I have worked hard with my teammates to have a successful Chairman’s award submission. This is our second time preparing for this award, and therefore we have learned some valuable skills! The game this year is very exciting! As always, we have worked to develop a strategy that will hopefully be successful come competition season. With the new game, we are working on creating our Medieval “Standard”, which we will personalize to represent team Stryke Force. Overall this new season promises many great things! I look forward to being a part of it with my team!" -Emma Scheller, 2nd Year Team Member.
