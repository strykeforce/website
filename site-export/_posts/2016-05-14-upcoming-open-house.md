<p>The Stryke Force experience wouldn't be complete without the amazing team members who are a part of it. This Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, there will be open houses to introduce new kids to what Stryke Force is about. This event is open to any high school or middle school student interested in the team. Be sure to spread the word and encourage people to investigate at an open houses. There will be team members from both levels to answer questions and talk to people, a showcase of our awards and past robots, and different stations talking about the different organization parts of the team. Everyone is welcome to these open houses and the team looks forward to meeting new people and introducing them to the amazing FIRST program.</p>
