# Stryke Force FTC Kicks Off 2015 Season

The Stryke Force FTC team got off to a great start this week by taking part in the Marshmallow Challenge. The students were broken into groups of 3 and asked to build freestanding structures using spaghetti noodles, tape and string with a marshmallow balanced on the top. While one team emerged the clear victors, the kids all pulled together and worked well in their groups. A last minute save by Dan, a new addition to the FTC team, showed the kind of quick thinking that is sure to be an asset in competition. Go Stryke Force! ![DSC_0159](/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_0159-300x199.jpg)           ![DSC_0163](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_0163-300x199.jpg)               After that, the returning students worked on upgrading last year’s robot to work with the new Android technology that was introduced for the upcoming season.   We were also fortunate enough to have Stryke Force alumnus Katherine Rothe to walk us through the parts of last year’s robot, and to give us a presentation on using logic. Overall, it was a great start to the season! ![FTC 8-3-15 \(54\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/FTC-8-3-15-54-300x225.jpg)             ![DSC_0177](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_0177-300x199.jpg)
