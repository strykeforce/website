<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past Saturday Stryke Force members gathered at the Air Zoo to participate in the 2016 Honor Flight. The <a href="http://talonsouthonorflight.org/">Talons Out</a> organization  raises money to send war veterans to Washington D.C. to view their memorials. Our team </span>volunteers as the ground crew and sets up the parade route for the Veteran's Homecoming Parade.  Personally, I thought the whole experience was phenomenal and a great way for the FTC (middle school) and FRC (high school) teams to get to know each other better. It was also a great way to learn skills such as being civil and polite while giving directions, and to be patient when helping others.</p>
<h3><b>THEN, THE MAIN EVENT, THE VETERANS ARRIVED!</b></h3>
<p>It was incredible to see the number of community members who came for the parade.  To watch 32 World War II Veterans and 36 Korean Veterans walk the parade route surrounded by cheering and clapping people of all ages was a moving experience for both the Veterans and the crowd.  The people that lined the parade route were shaking Veterans’ hands to thank them for everything they’ve done for our country. Stryke Force was right there cheering with the best of them. My favorite part was seeing several of our team members helping the Guardians out by pushing Veterans in wheelchairs!  This is a great honor for Stryke Force, since one of the reasons we participate in this event is to honor our FRC &amp; FTC Mentors who have served in the Armed Forces.  It was an amazing evening that I will not forget. Thanks to all of you who came and helped us celebrate.</p>
