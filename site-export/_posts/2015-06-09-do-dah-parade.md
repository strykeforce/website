<p>This past Saturday Stryke Force participated in the Do Dah parade for our third time. The Do Dah parade started in 1981 and is a fun, silly, and innovative parade which serves as a nonprofit community organizing event. This annual event has become somewhat of a Stryke Force tradition. It was great to get the team back together as many Stryke Force supporters and team members walked together, including some new members as well! Our ranks continue to grow with time! We had a great time handing out candy, demonstrating our robots, and passing game pieces back and forth with viewers as we marched on. Can you imagine a better way to show Stryke Forceâ€™s spirit? Our participation in community events such as the Do Dah parade shows that we are more than an organization that builds robots, we are a community team that works to better not only ourselves, but where we live as well. Come check us out at the Portage Library Summer Kickoff where we will be building Legos on June 13th!</p>
