# Allendale Competition Recap

The Stryke Force FTC teams had another wonderful competition this weekend. the qualifying matches all went well, ending with 8553 in first place and 7228 in third. We allied with each other and the Tech Vikes to create the first seed alliance. In semifinals we won the first match, partly due to one of the opposing teams robots falling. In the second match it was our turn for technical difficulties, with one of our robots not responding, we lost that one but turned it around in the third semifinal where, after a close match, we won and went on to finals. In the first round we dominated again. However on the second final match we lost by twenty points. The last match of the competition was excruciatingly close, ending with us losing by twenty points once again.Â 8553 received the Control award for an awesome autonomous routine and came in second place for the Inspire award. 7228 received the Think award ![100_3243](/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/100_3243.jpg) All in all, it was a very fun and suspenseful competition. Although we didn't win the big first place award, we got second place and acquired more practice for the state competition. It was so amazing to be together with the team. Winning is always nice, but it's the teamwork, energy, and determination that makes the whole FIRST program incredible. ![100_3308](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/100_3308.jpg) **Upcoming Events:** **FTC State Competition**\- Lakeview High School- December 19th **FRC Game Reveal**\- January 9th
