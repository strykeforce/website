# FTC Kickoff 2015

The FTC kids got together this past Saturday for the long awaited reveal of the new FTC game.  Here they are getting ready for the big moment! ![Kickoff 1](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kickoff-1-1024x681.jpg)![DSC_0071](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC_00711-1024x681.jpg) This year’s game will be [FIRST RES-Q](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc/game)! ![DSC_0070](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC_0070-1024x681.jpg) After watching the video a couple of times it was time to get down to business. The kids spent the afternoon picking apart the game and familiarizing themselves with the rules and scoring.  Greg led the group in a brainstorming session and the ideas were flying! ![DSC_0088](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSC_0088-1024x681.jpg) ![Kickoff 2](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kickoff-2-1024x576.jpg) The kids were then given the task to bring their ideas and sketches to their next meeting.  We can't wait to see what they come up with!  Looks like it's going to be another exciting season for FTC!
