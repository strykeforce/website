The time has come where the FTC Season is kicking up into full gear and we have split into two teams!  Here are the teams for the 2016-2017 season!! **Team 8553 Screamin Eagles** Team 8553, the Screaming Eagles, is an all rookie team again this year.  There are five 6th graders, four 7th graders, and three 8th graders.  When I asked them where they went to school, I found out that these students are from 7 different middle school and, in addition, 2 of them are homeschooled.   So what are they looking forward to this season?  Building the robot, learning to program, and, of course, the competitions! Cameron added that he was looking forward to making new friends, and David is excited about scouting during the competitions. It’s sure to be an exciting season all around!  Go Stryke Force!   [caption id="attachment_4247" align="aligncenter" width="147"]![alex](/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Alex.png) Alex[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4248" align="aligncenter" width="151"]![anneka](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Anneka.png) Anneka[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4249" align="aligncenter" width="127"]![cameron](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Cameron.png) Cameron[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4250" align="aligncenter" width="100"]![cole](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Cole.png) Cole[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4251" align="aligncenter" width="90"]![david](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/David.png) David[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4252" align="aligncenter" width="140"]![eli](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Eli.png) Eli[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4253" align="aligncenter" width="133"]![emma](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Emma.png) Emma[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4254" align="aligncenter" width="143"]![gideon](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gideon.png) Gideon[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4255" align="aligncenter" width="121"]![jonathon](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Jonathon.png) Jonathon[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4256" align="aligncenter" width="144"]![sarthak](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sarthak.png) Sarthak[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4257" align="aligncenter" width="116"]![sylvia](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sylvia.png) Sylvia[/caption] [caption id="attachment_4258" align="aligncenter" width="136"]![tori](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tori.png) Tori[/caption]     **Team 7228 Special Air Service** Who is Team 7228 Special Air Service?  This year, our team consists of eleven 8th graders and one 7th grader.  We have 3 rookies, 5 second year students, and 4 students who have been with us for 3 years.   When asked what they were most looking forward to this year, the overwhelming response was building the robot!  Jager added that he was excited to see what challenges would be presented by building the robot and how they would overcome them.  Will is excited to see what it will look like.   Carter and Isaac are looking forward to the competitions.  So is Kjerstin, who is hoping to be a driver or coach this year.  The competitions are the high point of our season, and are sure to be exciting!
