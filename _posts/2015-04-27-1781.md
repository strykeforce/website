# FRC World Championship - Day 3

We had such an AWESOME time at Worlds this weekend! A million thanks to all of our amazing sponsors, parents, mentors, and endless fans. We've been dreaming of going to Worlds for the past six years, and thanks to your endless support our hard work has finally paid off. Saturday morning we were selected to join Michigan team 4967, That One Team, to join them in the finals for the Carver Division. Along with our alliance, including team 2852 and team 1768, we made it through the quarter-finals with the high score in both of our matches! Unfortunately it was not enough to advance on to the semi-finals, but the fun didn't end there! After we packed up the pit, everyone headed up to the stands to watch the Einstein finals, excited to see who would be crowned the FRC 2015 World Champion. The day ended with tons of dancing, laughing, and general awesomeness. Thank you to everyone for believing in us and supporting us. It was an amazing experience, thank you for for giving us this opportunity to see how big this world is, and how far our dreams can take us.
