Come and cheer them on at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">East Kentwood High School</span>, Opening Ceremonies will begin at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10:30am</span>! Go <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ffcc00;"><a style="color: #ffcc00; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.firstinmichigan.org/ftc/FTC_2015/west_mi.html" target="_blank">here</a></span> for more details about the event.</p>
<p>We asked current FTC students, and FTC alumni, to share advice they have for the rookie students at the competition:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay hydrated!!  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen closely to the instructions. Whether it’s from your own coach and mentors, or from the volunteers working at the event. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be kind and respectful to everyone. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk with other teams and make friends with the other students. Ask someone from another team about their robot, and tell them something about yours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be prepared for mishaps, not everything is going to run smoothly the whole time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay supportive of your team. Even if you have a bad match, cheer with your team, tell the drive team they did a great job, give each other high fives!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that the judges may be watching you throughout the day.  Act in a way that would that would make your team proud!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand by ready to help if things go wrong.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel proud of your accomplishments, no matter if you win or not!</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dance! Just do it!</span></li>
<li>Most importantly… Have fun!!</li>
</ul>
