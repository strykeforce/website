<p>Don't forget about your chance to come and see who the Stryke Force team is! On May 11,12,13 (Monday-Wednesday) at 5:30-7:30 each night you will have an opportunity to Â check out what it is like to be part of the FIRST Robotics FRC (high school) and FTC (middle school) programs. Our robots and team members will be there to tell you about the team and show you around our awesome space at Midlink. Come and ask questions, drive the robots, and see what we are all about.</p>
<p>We are located at 5200 East Cork Street in Kalamazoo Mi, 49048. A heads up to you all... The Sprinkle Rd exit is closed on Expressway I-94.</p>
<p>For any questions on directions or in general, you can contact us under the "contact" tab on the main menu of the website. See you in May!</p>
