<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, November 27, Stryke Force volunteered at the Kalamazoo Tree Lighting Ceremony for the third consecutive year. We handed out hot chocolate, collected canned goods for Loaves and Fishes, passed out maps, and spread holiday cheer! It was a wonderful way to spend time together before the build season kicks off in January.</span></p>
<p>Our Kalamazoo county community is very important to us, we could not exist without all their support. There's nothing we love more than volunteering at events such as this to give back to our community. Happy Holidays!!</p>
