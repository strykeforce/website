Nothing says summer like camp. Even though my friends and I didn’t go to a traditional summer camp, our time at Michigan Tech.'s Summer Youth Programs was a great way to spend a few weeks before our senior year. My name is McKenzie Elliott and my friend Karley Reed and I attended MDOT’s National Summer Transportation Institute (NSTI) for two weeks. The camp explored civil engineering through bridge building projects, city design competitions, and speakers from the university as well as professional engineers. The two weeks were a great mix of hands on learning and lecture type classes. My favorite part of the camp was getting to tour the insides of the piers of the Mackinac Bridge.

While we were at camp two other members of Stryke Force, Nick Stamper and Cole Richter, met up with us. They attended a robotics camp at Michigan Technological University, which seems fitting since robotics is a major part of all of our lives. Most of the other students I met were on their school or community’s robotics team, even the instructor for NSTI was a mentor for his town’s high school FIRST  team. Overall camp was wonderful for all of us and now I know a few more people who are also counting down the days until kickoff for robotics season.

Cole and I went to Michigan Tech for their Mobile Robotics course. Over the week, we worked with many different aspects of building a robot, from soldering the circuit board to actually assembling and programming the bot to follow a line. We used a program which used the language "C" and used that, combined with an MSP430 micro controller, to program the bot.

All in all, it was a very interesting and enjoyable week for all four of us. -Nick Stamper
