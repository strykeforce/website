<p>Today is the big day! As the sun goes down tonight, the build kids will be putting their built robot into a bag, where it will remain until just before the competition. Bag day signifies the moment when FIRST teams can no longer build their robot. The robot that is put in the bag is the robot the team will compete with. Our robot reflects several weeks of great work and, other than a couple of final adjustments to be done tonight, is perfectly ready for the bag.</p>

<p>From now until the competitions, Stryke Force members will focus on refining their strategy and the drivers will practice on the spare robot the team made. This next stretch of time focuses more on getting the team ready for the competition, rather than the robot. Next week the team will have a large meeting to learn and review competition expectations, finalize plans, and learn the cheers and dances that are customary for FIRST competitions. The FRC season is flying by with the team members diligently working to improve both the robot and the team as a whole.</p>
