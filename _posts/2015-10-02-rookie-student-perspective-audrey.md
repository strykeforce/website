# Rookie Student Perspective - Audrey

I was overcome by a sea of yellow, I never saw it coming. After all, why would I join a robotics club? I prefer English to the STEM stuff. However, I was overpowered, and here I am. Since joining the robotics club, I've met so many new people and learned a bunch of new things. Sometimes I mess up, you know, once or twice, but it's a great learning experience nonetheless. I've enjoyed being on a robotics club because it combines a lot of my interests. I get to write, talk to people, and I'm gaining knowledge about technology and business advertising. The people there are great, always joking with me and helping me out. My experience so far has been fantastic. I'm really looking forward to using my skill to work towards awards and overcome challenges. Without the business team, the build team would have not anything to build with, or for. I can't wait to help my team to success! Joining the business team of Stryke Force has been one of the best decision I've made in my high school years.![DSC_0004](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DSC_0004.jpg)
