# FRC World Championship - Day 1

Team Stryke Force arrived in St. Louis on Wednesday and proceeded to check into FIRST Worlds competition at the Edwards Jones Dome. We ran a practice match where we successfully accomplished our two can grab in autonomous. This is the first time at Worlds for all of our students, parents and most of our mentors, so we held a team meeting at the hotel to discuss the plan for the weekend. On Thursday we played four very successful matches. We are in the Carver division and we ended the day in third place. Many team members took advantage of the seminars offered, some are put on by teams, some are put on by FIRST, and some are put on by colleges. After lunch we attended the innovation faire, scholarship row and we toured some of the city. The exciting thing about Worlds is that we got to meet teams from all over the world and country! The boundaries extend way beyond Kalamazoo thanks to FIRST! We visited pits, watched the First Lego League (FLL), and showed our robot to other teams. In preparation for alliance selection we scouted other teams throughout the day. The day ended with opening ceremonies and our students eager excitement for another day of robotics!
