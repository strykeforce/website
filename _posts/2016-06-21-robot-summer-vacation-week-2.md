<p>Where in the World is Stryke Force?</p>
<p>The Stryke Force FTC team is traveling around Kalamazoo during their summer vacation. Can you guess where they are this week? Comment your guess and check in next week to see if you were correct!</p>
<p>Hint: Some of our FTC students take ATYP classes on this campus.</p>
