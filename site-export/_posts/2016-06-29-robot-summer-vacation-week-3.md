<p>Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with.</p>
<p>Freddie taught Robin Hood how to golf! Robin Hood and his caddie are all set to head out to the golf course!</p>
