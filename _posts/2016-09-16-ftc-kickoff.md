# FTC Kickoff

Our FTC teams met this past Saturday to celebrate the kickoff of the new season.  The conference room was filled to capacity with students, mentors and parents anxiously awaiting the the game reveal. ![1](/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1-300x200.jpg)d After our initial excitement, it was time to get down to business.  We had a great brainstorming session and kids left buzzing with ideas ![2](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2-300x200.jpg)

We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are looking forward to a fantastic season!  Go Stryke Force!
