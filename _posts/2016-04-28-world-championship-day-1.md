<p>We had a great first day in St. Louis! Once we arrived at the Edward Jones Dome we unloaded the trailer and headed to the Carver pits. We shipped our robot to St. Louis and it was waiting for us at the venue. We immediately set about unpacking the robot and setting up the pit. Later in the afternoon some members of the team went to check out the Innovation Faire. We had a great time meeting new teams as well as seeing some of our fellow Michigan teams.</p>
