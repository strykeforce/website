The Stryke Force FTC Team had a blast this past Saturday at the Portage District Library!  For the second year in row, we had the opportunity to take part in the Summer Reading Kickoff.  The theme this year was “Escape the Ordinary!”  We had a fabulous turnout, and since we were tagged as special guests in the library newsletter, we even had people come to the event looking for us!  Kids who came to our room could drive the robot, learn about electronics with Snap Circuits, and play LEGOs.  A special thanks to all the FRC team members who came and helped make this event a success!![Summer Reading Kickoff 2015 \(14\)](/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Summer-Reading-Kickoff-2015-14-199x300.jpg) ![Summer Reading Kickoff 2015 \(18\) \(1024x681\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Summer-Reading-Kickoff-2015-18-1024x681-300x200.jpg) ![Summer Reading Kickoff 2015 \(20\) \(1024x681\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Summer-Reading-Kickoff-2015-20-1024x681-300x200.jpg) ![Summer Reading Kickoff 2015 \(27\) \(1024x683\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Summer-Reading-Kickoff-2015-27-1024x683-300x200.jpg) ![Summer Reading Kickoff 2015 \(31\) \(1024x683\)](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Summer-Reading-Kickoff-2015-31-1024x683-300x200.jpg)
