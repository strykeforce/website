<p>Stryke Force would not be where it is today without the help and support of our amazing mentors and coaches. In order to learn more about these supportive people, I asked Cory Walters, Stryke Force Co-Coach, about his experiences with FIRST.</p>
<p>What's the best thing about being a coach?</p>
<p>I enjoy seeing the students develop from the time they first come in to the FIRST community to the time they leave. They gain a lot of new skills and grow to become better people.</p>
<p>How did you become a coach?</p>
<p>I knew Kim (head coach of Stryke Force)  before I moved to Kalamazoo, my former robotics team that I mentored had an alliance with Stryke Force during a competition, so when I moved here, I knew it was a good team, so I got involved.</p>
<p>What is something that is different this year as opposed to previous years?</p>
<p>I feel like the process is getting much smoother. Every year we gain more knowledge, so the whole season is going easier than before.</p>
<p>What is one of your favorite memories of Stryke Force?</p>
<p>I don't think I have one specific memory that I like better than others, but there is something that's happened repeatedly that I love. Every year, when we go to the World Championship, I really enjoy just seeing all of the people in the stands who are so enthusiastic about STEM and the new generation of leaders. That gives me a great feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stryke Force is absolutely lucky to have people like Cory with real life experiences in the STEM world who can not only teach how to handle a drill or come up with a game strategy, they also are role models and genuine friends to the kids on the team. Thank you, Coaches and Mentors!</p>
