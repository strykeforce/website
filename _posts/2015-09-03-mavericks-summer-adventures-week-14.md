# Maverick's Summer Adventures - Week 14

Summer break is officially finished, which means Maverick's summer adventures have come to an end. But that doesn't mean the fun has stopped! Maverick was welcomed back to Midlink by enthusiastic students ready for the 2015-2016 season. We've begun our weekly meetings and our mentors are teaching us all the skills we'll need to dive into the 2016 build season in January! Check out where Maverick has been all summer <http://strykeforce.org/category/robot-summer-vacation-2015/>
