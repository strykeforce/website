Our FTC season is off to a great start! The kids have been meeting since the beginning of August to learn some basic skills and get to know one another.

You may have seen them in your neighborhood collecting pop cans. They’ve been working hard, and have collected over 20,000 cans and bottles to meet their fundraising goal!

This past Saturday was the FTC Kick Off and Game Reveal day. We met at Stryker Instruments to watch as the game was unveiled. The teams spent the afternoon picking apart the rules and figuring out how to best score points. On Monday, the real fun will begin as they start to brainstorm ideas for robot design. We are looking forward to another great season!
