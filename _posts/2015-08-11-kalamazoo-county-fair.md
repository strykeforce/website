<p>As active members of 4-H, Stryke Force is once again showing off our robots at the Kalamazoo County Fair. From August 10-15 we will have robots from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 seasons set up in the Expo Center. Check out the robots anytime this week, and look for yellow T-shirts in the food booth on Thursday!</p>
