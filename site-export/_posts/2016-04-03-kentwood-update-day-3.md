<p>The Kentwood event turned out the be another wonderful competition for Stryke Force! Ending the qualification rounds as the fifth seed team, we were then selected by the first seed team: 3620, The Average Joes. Finishing the alliance with team 5622, The Green Hornets. We won two games immediately in the quarter finals. We then won the first semi finals with a score of 170 to 130. Then lost the second match with a score of 107 to 130. Lastly, in an extremely close match, we lost the third match by five points. At the end of the day, Stryke Force had many excellent achievements. We made it to the semi finals, and we won the Engineering Inspiration award; recognizing our passion for spreading STEM to everyone around us.</p>

<p>With the combination of these successes combined with those we earned at the St. Joe event, we are guaranteed a place at the State competition. In addition to this exciting news, through a lottery system done by the FIRST program, Stryke Force will also be going to the World's competition! The weekend has ended with many causes of celebration, and the opportunity to look forward to the advancements our team will be making from now until the State's competition.</p>
