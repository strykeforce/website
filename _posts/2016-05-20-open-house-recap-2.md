![IMG_0085](/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0085-1.jpg) Stryke Force is enthusiastically preparing ahead for the coming year with open houses and recruitment techniques. We were excited to hold three days of open houses this week, each one being a phenomenal success. An average of ten families stopped in each day, bringing in new, interested kids from all around Kalamazoo, from both middle and high school. Tours were given to each of these families, showing off our amazing work space and team accomplishments. We were super excited to spread our love of STEM across the community, helping more kids participate in the FIRST program. All of the students that came seemed very enthused by this tour and there is a high probability of bringing in an abundance of new kids for the incoming season. ![IMG_0082](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0082.jpg) **Upcoming Events:** **Do Dah Parade**\- June 4th
