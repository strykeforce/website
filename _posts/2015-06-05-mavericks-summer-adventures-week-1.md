**[Kovacic Family](#2131 "2015-06-05 14:05:13"):** Downtown!! Near Harrison & Michigan Ave.

**[Kari Panse](#5030 "2015-10-15 16:59:24"):** I think this organization is remarkable! I would have LOVED being a part of something that inspires creative thinking, yet in a tangible, industrious way. I hope that when my kids are old enough, they have the ability to join a team like this one!
