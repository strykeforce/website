<p>Yesterday's meeting included a list of competition guidelines that students should follow, here is a brief summary of the instructions given. Those marked with an aster-ix apply to other visitors as well, not just students.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close toed shoes are needed, they are mandatory to be in the pits, and recommended throughout the competition.*</li>
<li>Bring your own safety glasses, preferably the cheap ones because they may get lost/broken.</li>
<li>Be kind and courteous to everyone! Mentors, other teams, judges, other team members, etc.</li>
<li>On Friday, arrive punctually or early, seats are limited and Stryke Force wants to get as much room as possible.*</li>
<li>Drink water, stay hydrated</li>
<li>Sarah Milam has set up an awesome scouting program, if you are interested in helping out, Sarah is chief.</li>
<li>In the pits, answer the judges questions to the best of your ability, or defer them to someone else. Never say the forbidden terms "I don't know" or "s/he is wrong."</li>
<li>Last but not least, have fun, this may be a competition, but it's also a chance to hang out with your friends and enjoy yourself!</li>
</ol>
