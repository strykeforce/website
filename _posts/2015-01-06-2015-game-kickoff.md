<p>Saturday January 3, 2015 was the day we were all anticipating for many months. It was the day we gathered at Stryker to watch the big reveal of the FIRST Robotics 2015 game, Recycle Rush.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of Stryke Force FRC and some of FTC gathered Saturday morning at Stryker and anxiously awaited the announcement of the game. The countdown started and the team was intently watching the screen, notebooks in hand, ready to start brainstorming. Once the rules and the game idea was announced, ideas began flowing nonstop. Everyone had many different ways to approach the game which gives us many fantastic options to work with. One of our very courageous team parents, braved the roads and went to Grand Rapids to retrieve the kit of parts. We were glad to have the alumni there to help support us and our ideas, and lend their help and expertise to all of the new members.  We split off into groups to brainstorm ways to make this year the best year yet for Stryke Force.</p>
<p>We gathered again on Sunday for our design session. We were unexpectedly delayed due to a bird invasion! After successfully releasing the bird back outside, we began talking out ideas for how we will begin to tackle the game. We are very excited for this year's competitions and we hope to see you all there! Our first competition will be in Kentwood on March 6-7 and then in St. Joe on March 20-21.</p>
