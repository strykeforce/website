<p>After the competitions, things are settling down for the year at Stryke Force, however, the end of the build season doesn't entail the end of amazing team events! This past weekend, the whole Stryke Force family  got together at Milham park to enjoy the beautiful weather and have fun. The whole range of Stryke Force came, FTC kids, mentors, family members, and FRC students. Activities included outdoor games,  tightrope walking challenges, and a delicious cookout.  The annual team picnic was a super awesome way to hang out with the team and focus on building friendships, instead of building robots.</p>
