<p>Stryke Force is not only a fun way to spend the present, it also gets students ready for the future. Beosker Posey the Fourth, an alumni student currently attending Western Michigan University who graduated in 2013, was asked a few questions about how his Stryke Force experience helped him after high school.</p>
<p>How has Strkye Force helped you prepare for life after high school?</p>
<p>It was really great in helping me find connections with people in the area that helped me know what job I wanted to get and set me up for college. Also the people on Stryke Force really showed me how to be a better person. Working together, having a positive attitude, and just finding the fun in everything were all things I learned from Stryke Force.</p>
<p>What was the most important skill you learned from Stryke Force?</p>
<p>I think that the most important skill was probably learning how to work as a team. I have to cooperate with many different groups of people in life, so it's really great that Stryke Force prepared me for that. It's easier to compromise and work together in order to get a job done more effectively.</p>
<p>What is one of your favorite memories of Stryke Force?</p>
<p>My last year we went to the state competition. It was a moment where we hadn't been doing so good, the robot was malfunctioning and we had lost the last couple matches. But then the song Cotton Eye Joe came on, and my friends Taylor, Katherine and me all got up and danced together. That felt amazing because, you know, we're kinda awesome!</p>

<p>It's exciting to know that Stryke Force doesn't just help students have a better present, they also help provide a great future. From learning life skills to making strong memories, Stryke Force impacts our members life's.</p>
