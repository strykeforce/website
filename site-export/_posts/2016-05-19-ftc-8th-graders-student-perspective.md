<p>FTC kids are an incredible part of the Stryke Force experience. We have four amazing 8th graders graduating from the FTC program, here is what they have to say about their experiences.</p>

<dd>So far, I've really enjoyed practicing driving the robot. It was fun to compete with our two robots to see who could be the fastest. I've had a great time in Stryke Force so far, at one of the competitions it was our team and another partnered against our other team and our partners other team. It basically came down to who could do the best driving and who had the best start. I'm looking forward to getting the next competition in the coming FRC season and figuring out what design will work best</dd>

<div> The thing I like best about Stryke Force is the teamwork.  One of my favorite memory's about Stryke Force is my first year when I was driver. Things I am looking forward to next year are going to see the other robots and the competition.</div>

<p>One of my favorite things about Stryke Force is learning about all kinds of new stuff regarding science, engineering and programming especially. It's all stuff I'm really interested in, but didn't have a good way to learn about before. Some things that I am looking forward to are learning more about robotics and making more friends that I share interests with.  I will always remember having a lot of funny and/or interesting discussions with my friends.</p>

<p>This past year was Tommy's first year on Stryke Force and he was a valued and amazing team member.  He greatly enjoyed watching the competitions. The FTC program will miss him next year.</p>
