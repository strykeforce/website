# Teaching How to Weld- A StrykeForce Student's Perspective

I had the opportunity to teach welding to two students this summer. We started by learning about the welder and basic techniques. From there I taught the students how to weld angles and shapes. Next the students worked on welding the parts of a t-shirt cannon. This provided a project I could oversee as they continued to weld and practiced the techniques. ![temp1_3](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/temp1_3-300x169.jpg) By Freddie Ouding
