# FTC Super-Regional Weekend Upate

What a whirlwind of a weekend! The FTC kids finished their competition in Des Moines.  They were amazing.  They bounced around in the rankings finishing 14th in their division of 36. They worked together as a team through adversity and triumph.  Every one of the students worked hard at their jobs to ensure a prepared robot was a contender in each match. Great friendships were made with each other and other Michigan teams.  Plans are in the making for a giant party at the end of the season with two of these teams. These students are proof that hard work and fun can work together to build a quality team, robot and ultimately a better world. The FTC league will miss some great students next year as Jack, Ross, Sierra, and Zach move up to FRC. Thank you for all your support throughout their season.
