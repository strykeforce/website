# FRC Update

While the FTC teams are focused on preparing for the FIRST State tournament, we can't forget that the FRC team is also busy preparing for their upcoming build season. These preparations have taken place in the form of testing and experimenting with new programming and building techniques, teaching the new recruits, raising money, and working on awards for the 2016 season. For the past month, many of the FRC students have been taking time to pass on their knowledge to the middle school students.

Volunteers include Kelsey Bruinwood, Sierra Staunton, Ryan Clare, and Audrey Rabick, with more students coming in order to cheer on the FTC teams. As the FTC competitions reach their height and the FRC game about to be revealed, things have been busy on all fronts of the Stryke Force team. Let's hope we continue to prosper and have fun as 2015 comes to a close. **Coming Up** **FTC State Competition**\- Lakeview High School, December 19th **FRC Game Reveal**\- January 9th
