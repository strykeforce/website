# World Championship - Day 2

Day 2 of the World Championship was fantastic! We played four matches today, winning three of them! A highlight of the day was during match 34 when we shot 9 high goal balls by our self! Along with their regular jobs of scouting, talking to the judges, and repairing the robot, the students visited the Innovation Faire, attended seminars, and met new teams.
