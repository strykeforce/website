<p>The World Championship competition ended in an exciting day. Stryke Froce was picked by the 4th seed alliance; which consisted of 842 Falcon Robotics, 4451 ROBOTZ Garage, and 1058 PVC Pirates. After several valiant matches we were knocked out in the Carver quarter-finals. Afterwards, it was super cool to watch the other teams progress, with a fellow Carver field team winning the world championship. In addition to doing well in our matches, Stryke Force was rewarded the Quality award for the efficiency and effectiveness of our robot. All in all, it was a highly successful weekend, and an amazing end to the 2016 build season!</p>
