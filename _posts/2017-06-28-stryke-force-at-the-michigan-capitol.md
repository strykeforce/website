Stryke Force FRC members had a fantastic day at the Michigan State Capitol. The day started out pretty great with an oppurtunity to take pictures and meet a couple state representatives, senators and Govenor Snyder! Students also had the opputunity to talk to the Kalamazoo Senator Margaret O'Brien and Represenative Brandt Iden about the championship experience and their plans for their future. After photos were taken, Stryke Force was given a small tour of the Captial building and had the oppurtunity to walk onto the House floor and be annoucned in the Senate floor about the team's success in the robotics world. Thank you to everyone that made this fantastic experience for the team possible! ![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1398.jpg)![](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_20170628_1318316341.jpg) ![](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170628_130650.jpg)
