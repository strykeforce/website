At the beginning of the season we did enough fund raising to fully support not only our FRC team, but two FTC teams as well. From giving formal presentations to local businesses, to writing for grants, we have worked hard to keep our teams running. We’ve also been working very hard at expanding our social media presence. This is important to us because it not only gets our name out into the community, but it’s also a great way for team member’s family and friends to stay up to date with the team. Within the past eight months we have completely redone our website, as well as started a blog. We are now up to over 200 likes on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/2767strykeforce" target="_blank">Facebook</a></span>, and over 600 followers on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/2767strykeforce" target="_blank">Twitter</a></span>, we’ve also recently created an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://instagram.com/2767strykeforce" target="_blank">Instagram</a></span>. Along with our social media we have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://eepurl.com/beGeFj" target="_blank">newsletter </a></span>that sends out monthly. The marketing part of the business team ordered t-shirts, banners, screwdrivers (to give to other teams at competitions), and bracelets for our FTC teams. We successfully completed and submitted three awards, the Woodie Flowers Award (Mentor Award), the Entrepreneurship Award, and the Chairman’s Award. A highlight of the season was definitely winning the Imagery Award at the Michigan FRC State Championship. Out of 102 teams at the competition, and over 300 teams across the state, we were recognized for having the best image/marketing/branding skills. We have organized and attended many community events, from volunteering at events such as Honor Flight and the Kalamazoo Tree Lighting Ceremony, to our most recent event, the open houses for interested students.</span></span></p>

We’ve also been helping our FTC teams work with the Portage District Library to participate in their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://strykeforce.org/events/event/legos-at-the-library/" target="_blank">Summer Reading Kickoff</a> </span>on June 13. Although our first competition won’t be until March, </span><span id="yiv8428334867yMail_cursorElementTracker_0.10261205839924514">we’ve already started writing the essay for the Woodie Flowers Award, as well brainstorming ideas for the Chairman’s Award. The business team is working hard to plan for a very successful 2015-16 season!</span></p>
