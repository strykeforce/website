At the moment, the business team is ordering shirts and other StrykeForce gear for the team. Also, they are focusing on planning out awards such as the Chairman's award and the Entrepreneurship award. These awards require various essays and write-ups, and a couple of videos. Also, the business team is ordering shirts and other StrykeForce gear for the team. So while the build team is building the robot in the following weeks, the business team will be occupied building up strong summaries that reflect how amazing the team is.</p>
