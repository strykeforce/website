# Senior Perspective

We had a phenomenal batch of seniors this year, all of whom we will miss immensely. Here is one final message about these amazing team members Garret: ![Scan0003](/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Scan0003.jpg) Hi I'm Garret, I recently graduated from Parchment High School. I will be attending Michigan Technological University in the great Upper Peninsula of Michigan to major in Mechanical Engineering. I plan on getting a minor in either Aeronautical Engineering or Biomedical Engineering while I'm at Tech. While I'm up there, I'll always look back on how wonderful my team has been and how much of a family they have become. I’ll never forget the day we won my first and only District Competition in St. Joe this year. Thank you to everyone for the great memories and new found friendships.

I will be graduating from homeschool this year.  I am still deciding on my plans for this fall.  With the amazing friends and mentors from Stryke Force cheering me on I feel confident taking on the world. The Stryke Force family has been amazing, and I can't thank everyone enough. No matter where I land I will be cheering for Stryke Force!
