# Robot Progress Report

The season has been going wonderfully for the Stryke Force team. The team has already made many accomplishments this season, the chairman's award has been submitted, the robot has been designed and a practice robot has been made. We have finished building all of the game pieces, they are on hand to be used to test and practice with the robot. Last Saturday brought some challenges but the team successfully got through it and made a lot of progress. ![100_0561](/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/100_0561.jpg) At the moment, the team is working on editing the final draft of the Entrepreneurship award, building the competition robot, refining the game strategy, and preparing the drive team for the competition. All of these things are being worked on consistently and yielding large progress. A new idea that is being incorporated is teaching several members of the team CAD. This advancement will better prepare the team for both this year and years to come. ![100_0600](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/100_0600.jpg) Upcoming projects include finishing and filming a video for the Chairman's award, practicing with the robot, and making adjustments to its infrastructure. The team has made a lot of progress from the beginning of the build season and are continuing to making giant bounds of advancement. With two weeks left until bag day, the entire team is working hard to continue this year's trend of hard work and success. ![100_0552](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/100_0552.jpg)
