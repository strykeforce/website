# Senior Spotlight - Jacob & Andrew

As the 2015 season is drawing to a close it’s time to begin saying goodbye to our wonderful seniors. We’ll miss you all more than words can express, and we wish you the very best wherever life takes you!

**Jacob Booth**

Jacob Booth has been a member of Stryke Force for the past 3 years. He has worked tirelessly as a volunteer at all of our competition since he joined the team. Jacob will be attending WMU to study mechanical engineering. Some of his favorite memories of the team include watching our previous mascot, Noah, dance all day everyday at the competitions.
