<p>Here are two more seniors we will bid a fond farewell to this coming summer, the Stryke Force team wishes them luck in life and will miss them immensely.</p>

<p>I have been involved with Stryke Force since our rookie year in 2009. My brother joined the team that year and my mom began coaching the following season. Growing up with Stryke Force I’ve seen the team grow from a small, struggling rookie team, to being ranked 10th in our state and winning awards at a World level. I have learned so much being on the business team the past four years. My mentors have done far more for me than just teaching business skills. I will never be able to thank them enough for everything they’ve taught me. Next year I will be attending Calvin College in Grand Rapids to study business. The past 8 years with Stryke Force have left me with more happy memories than I can count. I’m so proud of everything we have accomplished and I’ll miss my Stryke Force family more than anything.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I joined the team my freshman year and again when I was a sophomore. My sophomore year I was living in Canada but I was able to work on my part of the scouting program and send it over. Senior year I was Scouting Overlord. It was nice to have that responsibility and to experience working on a long project that actually affects other people. I will be attending Calvin College next year to study civil engineering, and later I'll get a degree in structural engineering.</p>
