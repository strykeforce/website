This was my first year doing FIRST Robotics. I had never heard of FIRST before so I had no idea of what to expect. I heard about this program from my electronics and robotics teacher and a class mate of mine. I didn't expect that it would be on such a big scale. With people from across the world all taking part in this program, and learning from first hand experience what engineers do. I joined Stryke Force and learned so much in the small window of time. The first day I ever walked into Stryke Force we were dissembling a robot from a previous year. The pace only increased from there. We put the engineering process into practical use, brainstorming, prototyping, etc. I truly never expected that, in high school I would have to chance to help build a robot of that magnitude. Towards the end of the year even my grandfather ended up volunteering and he absolutely adored it. All in all I am very grateful to my robotics teacher for informing me about FIRST. It is a great experience, extremely educational, fun, and practical.
