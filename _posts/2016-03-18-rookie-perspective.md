The first Stryke Force competition you go to is always awe-inspiring. In order to grasp how spectacular the St. Joe competition was for some of the new recruits, I interviewed a tenth grader who is new on the team this year; Erich. ![IMG_0707](/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_07071.jpg) In three words, describe your experience at St. Joe.- I've got to go with awesome, interesting, and, well, REALLY awesome! What was your favorite part? - That's a tough one, I guess I'd say I enjoyed watching our robot actually do something and seeing the effects of our hard work pay off as the points went up. What are you looking forward to for the rest of the season.- Seeing more of other team's designs, there are some really good ideas out there and I can't wait to see them. I like knowing that everyone did things a different, interesting way. ![100_0780](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/100_0780.jpg) The FIRST competitions are always a treat, and whether it's you first time or your sixth, be sure to stop by for the Kentwood competition coming up April 1st and 2nd.   **Upcoming Events:** **East Kentwood Competition:** April 1st & 2nd **States Competition:** April 14th, 15th, & 16th
