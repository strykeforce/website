<p>We had a fantastic weekend at the Michigan State Championship!!<br />
We won our last qualification match this morning, giving us an 12-0 record. We entered the alliance selections in 1st place as the only undefeated team at the tournament! Team 33, the Killer Bees, and Team 1684, the Chimeras, joined our alliance and we headed into the elimination matches. We played hard in our first match, winning 174 to 107. Our next two matches were close, 160 to 167, and 157 to 159. We gave our best, but we got knocked out in the octofinals.</p>
<p>The day was not over however, after the finals matches came the awards ceremony! Out of all 103 teams at the Michigan State Championship, and 411 teams in the state of Michigan, we won the Industrial Design Award! The Industrial Design Award "Celebrates form and function in an efficiently designed machine that effectively addresses the game challenge."</p>
<p>This weekend was full of many high points, and few low points. All of the team members stayed positive and supportive through it all. Everyone was dancing, singing, and cheering on the other teams all the way to the awards ceremony. We had an awesome weekend and none of it would be possible without our amazing supporters. The support of our sponsors made not only this weekend successful, but our entire season. We will never be able to express enough gratitude to our mentors to let them know how much they mean to us. A huge thank you goes to our parents for their endless support. We're extremely grateful for your willingness to drive up to the venue each day to cheer us on, bring us lunch, and encourage us through everything.</p>
<p>This has been an awesome weekend, we'll see you in St. Louis!</p>
