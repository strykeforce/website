## HOORAY FOR STRYKE FORCE!!!

![](/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture1.png) Stryke Force performed fantastically at this year's West Michigan Robotics Invitational. For those of you who couldn't be there, after arriving at the competition at eight o'clock in the morning, the team prepared for the game. After a few minor losses at the beginning, the team got into their groove and wrapped up the morning with a series of excellent wins. After lunch we continued our winning streak, climbing our way up to first place. We selected the teams R.O.B.O.T.I.C.S from Holland Christian, Buc'n'gears and the P.A.N.T.H.E.R.S for our alliance, with them, we did wonderfully at the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals, winning game after game. In the end, we won the tournament, but more importantly, we learned valuable strategies and techniques for competitions and had lots of fun. ![Capture 2](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture-2.png)
