The whole team is buzzing with excitement over the upcoming World's championship. We qualified for it in the State competition, in the twenty-seven years of FIRST robotics, we are the second team to ever go undefeated in the qualifying matches, ranking us as 10th in Michigan and making us all the more happy about going to Worlds. This event will start on Wednesday April 27th and go through Saturday April 30th. Taking place in St. Louis, Missouri, it promises to be a fun and fantastic event that all are welcome to. ![Screenshot_2015-04-24-21-06-23-2](/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot_2015-04-24-21-06-23-2.jpg) A few quick reminders to both adults and students

  * Remember your gracious professionalism towards all.
  * Close toed shoes and safety glasses are REQUIRED to enter the pit area.
  * Passes are needed to enter the building (contact Kim)
  * Students are not allowed across to the park alone... take a couple of buddies.
  * Other than the building and the park, students must be accompanied by an adult to go anywhere else.
  * The building is BIG, comfortable shoes are recommended and schedule for it to take a while to get places inside.
  * Stay in pairs if at all possible, especially when leaving the building.
  * Inform a mentor before leaving the building.
  * Remember to have fun! This championship is so exciting and we should all be proud of ourselves.
