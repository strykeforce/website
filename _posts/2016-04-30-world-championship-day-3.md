<p>Another wonderful day has passed for the Stryke Force team. The qualifying matches ended with Stryke Force winning six out of ten matches. We had some close calls and many amazing plays. These wins landed us in 13th place on the Carver field, out of about 75 teams!  In addition to playing matches and scouting, the Stryke Force team got to walk around St. Louis, attended the Innovation Fairs, and attended some great seminars! The judges came by the pits several times today to ask questions about our robot, business team, and more! Tomorrow morning the Carver/Curie field awards will be announced and we we enter the alliance selection. We look forward to another exciting day tomorrow, with a set strategy of alliance picks thanks to our amazing scouting students. The whole team is having tons of fun here in St. Louis!</p>
