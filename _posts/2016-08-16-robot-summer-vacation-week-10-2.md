# Robot Summer Vacation - Week 10

Where in the World is Stryke Force? The FTC students took their robot for a walk in the park. Can anyone guess where they're at? Comment your guess and check in next week to see if you were correct! Hint: The FRC robot visited the park at the other end of the trail [last summer](/2015/07/10/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-6/).
