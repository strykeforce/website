What are you looking forward to this year: I am looking forward to having another great year with some pretty awesome people!       ![Junior - Vicksburg Highschool - 3rd year on Stryke Force](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150813_114322-300x300.jpg) **Cole R.** Junior Vicksburg High school Build team 3rd year on Stryke Force         Favorite team memory: My favorite team memory was when we got to go to Worlds. It was a really fun experience for all of us. I really liked meeting other teams and seeing teams from foreign countries. What are you looking forward to this year: I am looking forward to meeting new people this year and taking on this year's challenge.   ![IMG_20150813_113937](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_20150813_113937-300x300.jpg) **Kelsey B.** Senior Homeschool Business team 4th year on Stryke Force         Favorite team memory: The St. Joe competition in 2013 where I was nicknamed Angry Pants, and last fall when I presented to a potential sponsor and received a $5000 donation. What are you looking forward to this year: I'm looking forward to seeing all our hard work pay off at the competitions. And dancing and cheering on the team!
