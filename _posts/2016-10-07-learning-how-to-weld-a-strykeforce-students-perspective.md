This past summer and fall we held a welding class. One of our students, Freddie Ouding,

welded most of our aluminum frame for our robot last year. This past summer Freddie worked

with Karley and I teaching us how to TIG weld aluminum. We started with laying a bead and

worked up to angles, joining metals and ultimately making the structure for a t-shirt cannon. I

look forward to practicing more this year to improve my skills. I hope to help offset the load on

Freddie and our mentors to have a working chassis. It was a lot of fun to learn to weld. There

were more details and fine points then I thought. It was especially fun to learn from a fellow

student.
