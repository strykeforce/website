<p>The stands will feel a little emptier this year. One of our great supporters recently lost his battle with cancer.  John Baderow was a fantastic and positive support, always cheering us on.  His daughter Katie is an integral member of our team. He will be greatly missed by The Stryke Force Family.</p>
