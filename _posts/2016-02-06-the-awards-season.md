Many of these awards require prior preparation. The business team has been hard at work preparing for these, and completing the necessary tasks to be ready since early in the fall.  The most prestigious FIRST award is the Chairman’s award. This is an award given to a team the exceptionally demonstrates the values of FIRST. By winning this award at Districts, a team will automatically qualify for States.  In order to enter, Stryke Force must submit an essay, executive summaries, and a video. Stryke Force students will also give a presentation to judges at the competitions. The business team has worked hard to prepare these items. Students have shared the work for these aspects, and gone through an important brainstorming  and editing process. The essay and executive summaries have recently been submitted and the video is in progress.  The business team looks forward to entering the 2016 season competing for Chairman’s.  Another important award that Stryke Force is working on is the Entrepreneurship award. This is a collection of medium length writings that explain to the judges the different aspects of Stryke Force, organizational structure, financial statement, community presence, etc. This award is already written and will soon be edited. ![100_0602](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/100_0602.jpg)
