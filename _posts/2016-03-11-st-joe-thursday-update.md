# St. Joe Thursday Update

As the excitement comes to a point, Stryke Force is set and ready for the matches tomorrow. This afternoon, members of the team went to St. Joe to prepare.

On the scouting side of things, we scouted some of the other teams, seeing what they were like and what their robots could do, and talked to our scouting partners, Excel and the RoboRangers, in order to collaborate on the scouting plan.

All of our efforts through the last few weeks will show just before noon as our robot competes in the matches! Even now, Stryke Force is off to a great start. **Coming Up:** **St. Joe Competition: **March 11th & 12th (This weekend!) **East Kentwood Competition:** April 1st & 2nd **States Competition:** April 14th, 15th, & 16th
