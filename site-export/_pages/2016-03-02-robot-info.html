<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Shooter</b></span></h2>
<p>The shooter allows us to shoot in either the high or low goal. The four balanced pitching wheels only engage when the drivers initiate them. The intake drops the ball into the shooter, and there is a rack and pinion driven linear which feeds the balls into the wheels without spin. This feeding is consistent and provides an accurate shot every time</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Software</strong></span></h2>
<p><b>100%</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">coded by</span> <b>students</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in C++ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy is imperative in any game play. We’ve made the specifics of the robot mechanisms depend on our strategy of achieving the maximum amount of points per second. We’ve purposely designed our robot code to be easily adjustable to evolving game strategies in this way.</span><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We use multi-threaded code, which means that if one part of the code fails, the rest of the systems continue working.  Most actuators are controlled with PID closed loop control.</span></strong></p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Suspension</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our robot uses a suspension to cushion it when driving over defenses. There are two hinges along the back and front of the bot, and a slot joint which moves in the middle. Springs compress when going over defenses. The goal of our suspension is shock absorption. Absorbing shock allows us to traverse obstacles at a higher velocity without breaking mechanisms or causing other reliability issues. The robot has a tank drive with wheels not treads. There are four wheels on each side, in which the outside two are ¼” off the ground. This increases our ability to make sharp turns.</span></p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Intake</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intake is a rotating bar with surgical tubing for traction in order to grab boulders. The surgical tubing on the bar help to center the ball into the intake. To reduce the range of loading on the intake pivot drive, springs stretch when the intake is out, aiding the drive when it lifts up to load a ball. The intake also has the ability to score into the low goal by itself. This minimizes shooting error and makes for a quicker cycle time.</span></p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sensors/Control</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Attached to the intake is a light beam sensor. This sensor signals the presence of a ball and ensures the robot picks up only one ball at a time. Once a ball has entered the intake, sensors stop the rolling bar - minimizing energy/voltage and preventing the ball from becoming mangled.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encoders are used in closed loop control schemes to control the velocity and position of the motors and actuators.  Several modes are available to the Drive Team as are multiple Auton options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are magnetic limit switches placed on the ball pickup and shooter to control the range of motion for each. </span></p>
