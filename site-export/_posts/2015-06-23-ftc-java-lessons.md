<p>FTC recently announced the transition to a new control platform for competition this coming season. This means that Stryke Force FTC gets to learn a new language! Maddie and Sam convinced FRC alum Katherine to teach them Java, which is the new language for FTC. Maddie and Sam are excellent students and are making great progress on learning the language, especially since they both had previous experience programming in Labview last year on Stryke Force Screaming Eagles and SAS. They are very excited to try out their new skills on robots this coming season, and canâ€™t wait for the release of the new software and hardware from FTC. Go Robots!</p>
