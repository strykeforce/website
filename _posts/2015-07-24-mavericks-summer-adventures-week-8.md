This week Maverick went adventuring with these two historical figures. Can you guess where he was at, and who he's with? Comment your guess and check in [next week](/2015/07/31/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-9/) to see if you were correct! This summer Maverick is going on vacation to tour Kalamazoo with his Stryke Force friends. We'll be posting pictures of his adventures each week, so be sure to look for them!
