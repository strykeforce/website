Today the team traveled to Kentwood to kick off the competition weekend! We passed inspection and made sure the robot was up and running! The team set up our Pit, the Stryke Force "Hangar", and some team members began scouting other teams for the next two days. We ran some practice matches to prepare for the competition that starts tomorrow morning after the opening ceremonies at 10:30. Hope to see you all sometime this weekend cheering us on in the stands! Tomorrow, the matches begin around 11 and end around 7. See you there!
