Now that the FRC team has received the game for the 2016 season, they will spend the next few weeks busy at work, designing, building, and testing the robot. In addition, they will think of a strategy to go by and assign roles for the competitions. The FRC team discussed different plans on Saturday in response to seeing the game, then they met again on Sunday to continue debating and organizing their thoughts. After these two highly productive meetings, the build team is ready to begin working. ![IMG_0754](/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IMG_0754.jpg)
