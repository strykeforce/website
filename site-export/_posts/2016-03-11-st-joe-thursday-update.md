<p>As the excitement comes to a point, Stryke Force is set and ready for the matches tomorrow. This afternoon, members of the team went to St. Joe to prepare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there, they successfully set up the pit, and passed the robot inspection where judges insure the robot is fit to compete. On the scouting side of things, we scouted some of the other teams, seeing what they were like and what their robots could do, and talked to our scouting partners, Excel and the RoboRangers, in order to collaborate on the scouting plan.</p>

<p>For the rest of the night, the team plans on practicing with the competition robot. All of our efforts through the last few weeks will show just before noon as our robot competes in the matches! Even now, Stryke Force is off to a great start.</p>
