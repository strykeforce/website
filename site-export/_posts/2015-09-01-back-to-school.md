<p>Over the past few weeks our Stryke Force alumni have been heading back to school. It was great to reconnect with some of them over the summer at our various community events. A couple of our alumni even taught classes to our FTC students. With alumniÂ at over 15 colleges around the world, the Stryke Force students are spreading the word of FIRST far and wide. Good luck to everyone in the 2015-2016 school year, we'll see you at kickoff!</p>
