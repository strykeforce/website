<p>Four years as a team member of Stryke Force truly prepared me for the most diverse range of challenges, one of which is, of course, college. The repeated experience of being fully responsible for a presentation or project has given me more confidence in my abilities, not to mention developed my adaptation skills (I've found these to be essential in the oftentimes unpredictable atmosphere on campus). Simply the time spent collaborating with friends on the team taught me how to better read others and their comfort levels, which is invaluable in any scenario. The academic/practical aspects of FIRST undoubtedly lend themselves well to your studies, but I would urge all of the up and coming team members to not miss the tidbits on tackling life that are often shared by our mentors. These have frequently provided me strength and comfort as I adjust to the daunting idea of being independent 24/7. Good luck this season to the Stryke Force family, and see you all soon!</p>
