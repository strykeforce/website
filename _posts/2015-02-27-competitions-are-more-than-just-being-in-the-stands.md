Our first competition of the year is coming up next week, and we have quite a few new members on the team, so we thought we would give them, and you, an idea of what a competition is like. We arrive on Thursday late in the afternoon to begin our set up for the competitions on Friday and Saturday. One of the biggest parts of the competition are the Team Pits, which reflect the teams' style and mission. During competition days, one of the most interactive things to do is to visit the pits of other teams, see their various design styles,  get up close and personal with the robots, and collect their buttons and souvenirs... but don't forget to collect your Stryke Force button and mini plane at the Stryke Force Hangar! If you can't come and join us for the entire competition weekend, the best time to arrive would be Saturday afternoon after lunch, which generally begins around 1:00pm. The big alliance selections will begin before lunch, but the playoffs will commence afterwards.  Saturday afternoon is when the game gets heated, and the crowd is most energized! So come join us next weekend at Kentwood March 5-6! For more information about the competition go to-http://strykeforce.org/events/event/frc-kentwood-district-competition/
