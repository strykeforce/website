# Business Team Update

The business team has been working hard the past couple of months. We have a brand new website up and running, we've designed and ordered this year’s t-shirts, and we have been working on awards for the competition. Some of these awards include, the Woodie Flowers award (best mentor award), Entrepreneurship award, and the Chairman’s award. We've been writing essays, shooting video and taking pictures. Some students on the team were also fortunate enough to attend a business conference put on by Southwest Michigan First at Wings Stadium. There were many amazing speakers from all around the country. It was a truly remarkable experience and we are very grateful to have been given the opportunity to attend.
