<li dir="ltr">Crossing defenses</li>
<li dir="ltr">Scoring boulders through goals in the opposing tower</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li dir="ltr">Defend their castle</li>
<li dir="ltr">Retrieve boulders</li>
<li dir="ltr">Defeat defenses</li>
<li dir="ltr">Score goals from the opponents’ courtyard in tower</li>

<p dir="ltr"><b>The Outer Works </b></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">  Eight defensive options (over 18,000 possible field configurations)

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Illuminated lights on each defense reduce when an opposing robot fully crosses it for first time</li>
<li dir="ltr">These lights go dark after the defense has been crossed a second time, signaling it’s considered damaged</li>
<li dir="ltr"> Once any four of the five defenses are damaged, the fortifications are considered breached and the charging Alliance is rewarded with points</li>

<p dir="ltr"><b>The Tower </b></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">  Openings in the tower are available for robots to score boulders
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Scoring boulders reduces a tower’s strength as indicated by decreasing tower lights</li>
<li dir="ltr">The tower’s flag will drop when enough boulders are scored and then the tower can be captured at the end of the Quest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><b>The Capture </b></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"> During last 20 seconds of the Quest, robots may surround and scale the tower to capture it</li>

<h2>2015: Recycle Rush!</h2>

<p>This year’s game is called Recycle Rush! Below is a summary of the game, to find the full game manual go to http://contentviewer.adobe.com/s/FIRST/29d775cf-7df1-5bea-97a2-3309a6deda88/FRC2015GameManual/cover.html</p>
<p>Game Summary<br />
RECYCLE RUSH is a recycling-themed game designed for the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It is played by two Alliances of three<br />
Teams each. Alliances compete simultaneously to score points by stacking Totes on Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling<br />
Containers, and properly disposing of Litter, represented by pool noodles, in designated locations. In keeping with the recycling theme of the<br />
game, all scoring elements used are reusable or recyclable by teams in their home locations or by FIRST at the end of the season.<br />
The 27 ft. by 54 ft. playing Field is bisected by a small Step which may not be climbed on or crossed by Robots. Thus each Alliance competes<br />
on their respective 26 ft. by 27 ft. side of the Field.<br />
Each RECYCLE RUSH Match begins with a 15-second Autonomous Period in which Robots operate independently of their drivers. During this<br />
period, Robots attempt to move themselves, their Yellow Totes, and their Recycling Containers into the area between the scoring platforms,<br />
called the Auto Zone. Additional points are awarded if the Yellow Totes are arranged in a single stack. Points for this period are shown below</p>
<p>ROBOT SET – 4<br />
TOTE SET – 6<br />
CONTAINER SET – 8<br />
STACKED TOTE SET – 20</p>
<p>During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds of the Match, called the Teleop Period, Robots are controlled remotely by student drivers<br />
located behind the walls at the ends of the Field. Teams on an Alliance work together to place as many Totes on their Scoring Platforms as<br />
possible. Alliances earn additional points for Recycling Containers placed on the scored Totes, with Recycling Containers at greater heights<br />
earning more points.<br />
Alliances also earn points for disposing of their Litter in either their Landfill Zone (the area next to the Step marked by the white line) or placing<br />
Litter in or on scored Recycling Containers. Alliances that unscored leave Litter on their side of the Field at the end of the match add points to<br />
the score of the other Alliance, as it is considered unprocessed and not properly disposed of.</p>

<h2>2014: Aerial Assist!</h2>
<p>[embed]http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxp4dkMQ1Vo[/embed]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AERIAL ASSIST is played by two competing Alliances of three robots each on a flat 25’ x 54’ foot field, straddled by a truss suspended just over five feet above the floor. The objective is to score as many balls in goals as possible during a two (2)-minute and 30-second match. The more Alliances score their ball in their goals, and the more they work together to do it, the more points their Alliance receives.</p>
<p>The match begins with one 10-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate independently of driver. Each robot may begin with a ball and attempt to score it in a goal. Alliances earn bonus points for scoring balls in this mode and for any of their robots that move in to their zones. Additionally, each high/low pair of goals will be designated “hot” for five seconds, but the order of which side is first is randomized. For each ball scored in a “hot” goal, the Alliance earns additional bonus points.</p>
<p>For the rest of the match, drivers remotely control robots from behind a protective wall. Once all balls in autonomous are scored, only one ball is re-entered in to play, and the Alliances must cycle a single ball as many times as possible for the remainder of the match. With the single ball, they try to maximize their points earned by throwing balls over the truss, catching balls launched over the truss, and scoring in the high and low goals on the far side of the field.</p>
<p>Alliances receive large bonuses for “assists,” which are earned for each robot that has possession of the ball in a zone as the ball moves down the field. Points are awarded for each action per the table below.</p>

<h2>2013: Ultimate Ascent!</h2>
<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHNW2OFr4Y[/embed]</p>
<p>ULTIMATE ASCENT is played by two competing alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 foot field. Each Alliance consists of three robots, and they compete to score as many discs into their goals as they can during a two (2)-minute and fifteen (15)-second match. The higher the goal in which the disc is scored, the more points the Alliance receives.</p>
<p>The match begins with a fifteen (15)-second Autonomous Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs. Discs scored during this period are worth additional points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their alliance score by scoring as many goals as possible.</p>
<p>The match ends with robots attempting to climb up pyramids located near the middle of the field. Each robot earns points based on how high it climbs. Scoring for the match is summarized below.</p>

<p>Rebound Rumble  is played by two competing Alliances on a flat, 27 x 54 foot field. Each Alliance consists of three robots. They compete to score as many basketballs into their hoops as they can during a 2 minute and 15 second match. The higher the hoop in which the basketball is scored, the more points the Alliance receives.</p>
<p>The match begins with a 15-second Hybrid Period in which robots operate independently of driver inputs. During this Hybrid Period, one robot on each Alliance may be controlled using a Microsoft Kinect. Baskets scored during this period are worth extra points. For the remainder of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their Alliance score by scoring as many baskets as possible.</p>
<p>The match ends with robots attempting to balance on bridges located at the middle of the field. In Qualification Matches, a robot from each Alliance will also try to balance on the white Coopertition bridge to score additional ranking points for each Alliance. Scoring for the match is summarized below.</p>
