# Goodluck FTC!

This morning, one of our FTC teams, Stryke Force SAS 7228, left for the Super Regional Competition in Des Moines, Iowa! The Super Regional is the competition level between States and Worlds. There are currently 291 FTC Teams in Michigan, and only 12 of them qualified to go to Iowa. On Thursday they will go through robot inspection, as well as their interview with the judges. The competitions commence on Friday and go through Saturday. While there, they will be competing against 71 teams. 60 of those teams are High School teams, so only 12 are Middle School! We are incredibly proud of them, and we wish them the best of luck on this adventure! We know they will do great. Stay tuned for updates and results! You can keep up with the competitions at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nsr-tinker
