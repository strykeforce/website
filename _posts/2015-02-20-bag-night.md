Tuesday Night, February 17, was quite the night! Bag night is the evening that we are required to put the robot in a bag at 12:00 am. The build robot was able to stack all 6 totes within the time limit! After 6 weeks of hard work and long hours, we got the robot in the bag with 5 minutes to spare. We now have 6 hours left to work on the robot in pieces while out of the bag.  The team is looking forward to the first competition in Kentwood on March 6-7!   This season the Business team has also been hard at work. We have been working on various awards that have all been submitted! The Woody Flowers Award (Mentors Award) requires a 3000 character essay, and the Entrepreneurship Award requires 9 - 1600 character essays. The Dean's List award requires a 4000 character essay and is submitted by a mentor and the same mentor nominates a Student leader on the team.  The final award to submit was the most prestigious award, The Chairmam's Award, which requires one 10,000 character essay, 11 - 500 character essays, one 3 minute video, and a presentation. We can't wait to see the outcome at the competitions!![Displaying photo.JPG](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=687341d4e2&view=fimg&th=14ba46f3bb55a371&attid=0.1&disp=inline&safe=1&attbid=ANGjdJ8DiHKO6MuNCRKzI4bWjTUWP71hMiUs7FDviCzWf2bUglo0v9G1mIgqoGodthe5bxEB6UcRn2nRGOSvk7REUfX-R6_jKc7Uy4uDjF5gPLFB609gqVU1LuskRu8&ats=1424392934580&rm=14ba46f3bb55a371&zw&sz=w1342-h547)
