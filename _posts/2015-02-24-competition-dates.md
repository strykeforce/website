<p>In just 2 short weeks, March 6-7, the team will travel to Kentwood for our first competition of the season! The event will be held in Kentwood, at East Kentwood High School. On Friday, the Opening Ceremonies begin at 10:30 am and the last matches end at 7:00 pm. On Saturday, the Opening Ceremonies begin at 9:00 am and the Awards are at 5:00 pm. Our second competition will be held at St. Joseph High School in St. Joe March 20-21, and the opening ceremonies and awards times are the same as Kentwood.</p>
