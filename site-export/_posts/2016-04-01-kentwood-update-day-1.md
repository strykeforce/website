<p>We had a successful load in during our first day of competition at East Kentwood! Our robot arrived and we assembled our pit for the weekend. We participated in several practice matches, visited with other teams, and practiced gracious professionalism by assisting other teams. We are excited for a successful and exciting<br />
day of competition tomorrow!</p>
<p>Come cheer with us on Friday and Saturday! More event information <a href="http://www.firstinmichigan.org/FRC_2016/Kentwood_FRC/kentwood_frc.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
