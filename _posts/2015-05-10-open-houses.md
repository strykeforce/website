<p>The week has arrived! Beginning tomorrow and through Wednesday, are our open houses! Each night they will be running from 5:30-7:30. You are welcome to come on any of the nights, and your friends and family are encouraged to come as well. Our space is located at 5200 E Cork St in Kalamazoo. You will be able to drive the robot, see the Pit, and talk to members of the build, business and programming teams. We hope to see you there! </p>
