<p>The end of Friday's matches brought a feeling of celebration among the Stryke Force students. Throughout the day, Stryke Force won seven of it's nine matches. The last one stood out particularly, with the entire game being close up to the end, where we won the match and scored the high score of the day. With this series of victories, Stryke Force ended up in second place, with all looking forward to the additional qualifying matches we will play tomorrow.</p>

<p>In other news, the scouting program went well once again, with the team spending Friday night discussing strategies and alliance possibilities using the information gained from the scouting. The Chairman's presentation was also a huge success, going over flawlessly after hours of practice beforehand.</p>
<p>Stryke Force looks forward to the matches coming tomorrow, working hard to improve upon the triumphs of today. For those of you who missed Friday's excitement, make sure to stop by on Saturday and check out Stryke Force and the FIRST program.</p>
