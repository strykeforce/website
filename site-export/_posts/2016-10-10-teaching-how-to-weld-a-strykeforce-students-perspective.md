<p>I had the opportunity to teach welding to two students this summer. We started by learning about the welder and basic techniques. From there I taught the students how to weld angles and shapes. Next the students worked on welding the parts of a t-shirt cannon. This provided a project I could oversee as they continued to weld and practiced the techniques.</p>
