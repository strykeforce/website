Maverick is celebrating Independence Day by paying his respects to the men and women who served to give us a free country. Can you guess where he was? Comment your guess and check in [next week](/2015/07/10/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-6/) to see if you were correct! This summer Maverick is going on vacation to tour Kalamazoo with his Stryke Force friends. We'll be posting pictures of his adventures each week, so be sure to look for them!
