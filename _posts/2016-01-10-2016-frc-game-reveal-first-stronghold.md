# 2016 FRC Game Reveal - FIRST Stronghold

Yesterday was the much anticipated FRC game reveal. Here is a brief description of this year's exciting game. [caption id="attachment_3270" align="aligncenter" width="1718"]![2016 Game Field](/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Field.jpg) 2016 Game Field[/caption]  

**The Quest **

  *  Robots operate independently for first 15 seconds of the Quest - Alliances score points by:
    * Reaching opponents defenses
    * Crossing defenses
    * Scoring boulders through goals in the opposing tower
  * Human drivers take control for the final 2 minutes and 15 seconds controlling their robot to:
    * Defend their castle
    * Retrieve boulders
    * Defeat defenses
    * Score goals from the opponents’ courtyard in tower
    * Capture and scale the opponent’s tower

**The Outer Works **(outermost line of fortification)** **

  *   Eight defensive options (over 18,000 possible field configurations)
    * One permanent (the low bar)
    * One chosen periodically by the audience
    * Three selected by Alliances just before each Quest begins
  *   Once the Quest begins
    * Illuminated lights on each defense reduce when an opposing robot fully crosses it for first time
    * These lights go dark after the defense has been crossed a second time, signaling it’s considered damaged
    *  Once any four of the five defenses are damaged, the fortifications are considered breached and the charging Alliance is rewarded with points

**The Tower **

  *   Openings in the tower are available for robots to score boulders
    * Scoring boulders reduces a tower’s strength as indicated by decreasing tower lights
    * The tower’s flag will drop when enough boulders are scored and then the tower can be captured at the end of the Quest

**The Capture **

  *  During last 20 seconds of the Quest, robots may surround and scale the tower to capture it
  * When capture is successful, their flag is raised on the opposing tower and even more points are earned

**The Alliance with the highest score at the end of the Quest wins! **
