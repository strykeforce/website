CAD Classes by Kyra Kothawala

At the end of August a new class started at Stryke Force - CAD! CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design. It is used to architect and help visualize designs while simulating how they will perform in reality. During the robotics season, CAD is used to create the design of the robot and test it before even being built. The class so far has taught me the basics of the Creo Parametric CAD software and how to navigate it. In addition, we have learned the different functions CAD can offer, including element analysis, performing calculations, and making sketches. We manipulate instructional designs to look at different parts and even design different objects from scratch. In the future we plan to look at FRC and FTC robots from the 2015-2016 season and develop our skills further! After the class, my peers and I hope to utilize our new abilities and participate in designing the upcoming season robot and any other projects!
