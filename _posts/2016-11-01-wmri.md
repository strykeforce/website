This past Saturday the FRC team competed at the West Michigan Robotics Invitational (WMRI). It was a great chance to reunite with robotics friends and test the robot improvements we made over the summer. At the end of the qualification round, we were fifth place.  We were picked by the third alliance  captain  team 141 [the Wobots](http://www.team141.net/). We chose a team from Canada for our third selection, team 2013 [the Cybergrnomes](http://www.cybergnomes.ca).

Although we had a mechanical problem with our shooter in quarterfinals, our drive team played outstanding defense helping our alliances win quarterfinals and move on to semifinals. Our pit crew was able to troubleshoot and prep the robot and we sailed through semifinals.

It was on to finals! We won our first match 145-139 and the second finals match 145-130, making is the winners of WMRI for the second time! After the celebration and awards ceremony we stayed to help tear down the field, roll the carpet and fold the tarps.

We would like to thank the coordinators of WMRI for putting on and running such an awesome event!! We can't wait for next year!!
