Earlier this morning we had the excellent opportunity of participating with KRESA and 4-H at the Kalamazoo Growlers Education Day. 2,8oo students from area schools came to learn about STEM, as well as watch the baseball game. We explained the FIRST program, and showed off our FRC and FTC robots. The students were very enthusiastic as we explained how the robots work, as well as watching a demo of our FTC robot. At the end of the 5th inning we put the robot on top of the dugout and shot balls out to Porter, the Growlers mascot. We love sharing our passion with others, so this was an awesome experience for us!
