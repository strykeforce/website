<p>We had three younger siblings affectionately known as 'RoboRats'. They watched and formulated a plan to start a FTC team. After all their hard work we knew we had to help them. As one of the RoboRats said, "I just had to be apart of it!" In the summer of 2013 four enthusiastic students put their plan in action. With the help of FRC students and mentors Stryke Force Special Air Service 7228 began. After two very successful seasons of FTC, Zach Palan-Lilland, Ross Malackowski, Sierra Staunton, and Jack Bruinwood, will be joining FRC team Stryke Force 2767. We couldn't be happier to have them! Here's what they have to say about their experience with FTC:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Zach Palan-Lilland</strong> <img class=" size-medium wp-image-2007 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_8191-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_8191" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">FTC was awesome last year. We all worked well as a team, and we made it far into the season. I am looking forward to FRC next year, and I hope that it's just as big if not a bigger success.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> FTC was my first experience with robotics, it was a great introduction into programming/engineering. I'm excited to move up to FRC and build and program bigger robots, meet new friends, and have fun. FTC has taught me how to problem solve, and it has taught me how to build/program more efficiently.</p>

I learned how to document the engineering process as well as build.  We had great mentors show us a bit of CAD.  Also, I learned how to create long lasting relationships as well as a robot.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">I love FTC because I made really good friends and had some awesome mentors. The most important thing FTC has taught me is how to communicate with other teams and not to get mad at each other when the robot does not work. I am really excited to move to FRC to learn more about robotics and to build more complicated robots.</p>
