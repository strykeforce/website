Our FTC team learned a lot about adapting today. The head referee interpreted rules differently than the referees in our 3 previous tournaments. With great tenacity the FTC kids worked on their game, never losing their positive attitude. We are extremely proud of their gracious professionalism in all circumstances. They have one match tomorrow before alliance selection. Good luck Stryke Force Special Air Service!! You make all of us proud!!!
