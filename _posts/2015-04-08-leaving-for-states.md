# Leaving for States!

This weekend, 102 of the top teams in Michigan will descend apon the Grand Rapids Delta Plex for a competition of tote-stacking, container-topping, noodle-throwing excitement. Today the Stryke Force team leaves for Grand Rapids to compete in the States Championship! We will unload the trailer and set up the pit when we arrive. Then we will goÂ through inspection and proceed to the practice fields! The Business Team will get the Judges pamphlets and buttons out on display and set up all the banners. Competition starts on Thursday at 1:00 pm after the opening ceremonies which begin at 12:30 pm. Matches will end around 8:00 pm. We hope to see you all in Grand Rapids sometime this weekend!
