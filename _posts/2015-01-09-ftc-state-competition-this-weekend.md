Over the past four months our two very talented Stryke Force FTC teams, Special Air Service (SAS) and The Screaming Eagles, have accomplished so much. SAS won the Inspire Award at the Allendale Qualifier, and the Think Award at the West Michigan Qualifier. They were also on the winning alliance in Allendale. SAS and The Screaming Eagles partnered at West Michigan to make it all the way to the finals.

Because of their hard work this season, both teams will be competing in the State Competition this Saturday (January 10) in Battle Creek. The competition will be held at Lakeview High School. Come out and cheer for our two outstanding teams! Opening Ceremonies begin at 10:50 am in the Main Gym. Hope to see you all there, it should be a great day!

Best of luck teams!
