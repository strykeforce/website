<p>This Friday and Saturday, March 20 and 21, The Stryke Force Team will be traveling to St.Joe for our Second competition weekend! Opening Ceremonies begin at 10:30am on Friday, and the matches end at 7:00pm. On Saturday morning, opening ceremonies start at 9:00am and the Awards Ceremony will begin around 5:00pm. The team has been working hard to review strategy and work on the robot to prepare for this weekend at St.Joseph High School. Come cheer us on in the stands, we hope to see you there!</p>
