# Senior Spotlight - Lizzy & Katie

As the 2015 season is drawing to a close it's time to begin saying goodbye to our wonderful seniors. We'll miss you all more than words can express, and we wish you the very best wherever life takes you!

Next year I'll be attending Haverford College, a small liberal arts school outside of Philadelphia, PA. I hope to study political science with a focus in international relations. No doubt I'll be using the presentation and strategy development skills I've gained during my time in the Stryke Force family. I'm sure I'll often look back on my four years with the team, from the first time I walked into a competition and was immediately pulled into an enthusiastic demonstration of the Cotton Eyed Joe, to my many days this year proudly bragging about our awesome team to friends, family, and prospective students. I can honestly say that I've never known a more unique, passionate, and persevering group, and it's been a privilege to see the team grow from a small, somewhat disjointed handful of students without much of a financial plan to a huge yellow powerhouse, not only on the field, but in our community as well. Best of luck next year guys, you're going to dominate!

The hours upon hours of work spent after school to put together a robot each year was worth it every season at the start of our first competitions. It’s been great watching the growth each year with more new members joining to be an important part of the team. In the fall I’ll be heading to Michigan State University where I will be studying computer science and engineering, a decision that was made final by me through my time in Stryke Force. I hope only the best for the team and its members for the next seasons and all that come after.
