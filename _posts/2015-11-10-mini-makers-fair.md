# Mini Makers Fair

The Maker's Fair at Barnes and Noble Friday and Saturday, November 6th and 7th was busy and packed full of potential team members and mentors.  Our table/booth was set up in a secluded corner, with a bright yellow table cloth, previous robots running around, and posters explaining our team set up, and attracted most of the attention even though it was by far the most hidden booth. We had interest in all the ages, ranging from four to some mentor aged adults.  It was really great to see the Middle School FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) teams shine with their communication to our community in short spiels about what FIRST robotics is and how it helps our community as well as offering to have people to drive.   Overall everyone had a great time talking about our team and how FIRST robotics makes our community shine through.   The high schoolers gave more input on who the FIRST community works and how to become involved with robotics. The fair was quite the success! -Sierra Staunton, FRC build team **Coming up:** **FTC Kentwood Qualifier Competition** - November 21st 8am-5pm - East Kentwood High School **Kalamazoo Tree Lighting Ceremony** - November 27th time TBA - Bronson Park **FTC Allendale Competition **\- December 5th 8 a.m-5 p.m -Allendale High School ![IMG_0660](/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0660.jpg) ![IMG_0671](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_0671.jpg)
