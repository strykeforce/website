<p>Yesterday we celebrated Mr and Mrs Cory Welch on their wedding day! His FTC students had this to say about Cory. He is amazing and awesome, helpful, cool and nice. He takes the time to show us how to design and build. Ashley is super cool for letting Cory spend so much time with us!! The kids talked about the best advice they could give them. They think that Ashley and Cory should have a bunch of kids just like them!! Congratulations Mr. And Mrs. Welch!!</p>
