<p>All of the students on the Stryke Force Team are buzzing with anticipation as the competitions come up. Here is Emma Scheller's, a business team member and two year student, perspective on what we've been working on.</p>
<p>"Going into my second year on Stryke Force, I am more excited than ever to be a part of the coming season.</p>
<p>As a member of the business team, I have worked hard with my teammates to have a successful Chairman’s award submission. This is our second time preparing for this award, and therefore we have learned some valuable skills!</p>
<p>The game this year is very exciting! As always, we have worked to develop a strategy that will hopefully be successful come competition season.</p>
<p>With the new game, we are working on creating our Medieval “Standard”, which we will personalize to represent team Stryke Force.</p>
<p>Overall this new season promises many great things! I look forward to being a part of it with my team!"</p>
<p>-Emma Scheller, 2nd Year Team Member.</p>
