# States Day 1

Today was the first day of the state championship competition in Grand Rapids. The day began with the Stryke Force Team playing in the first round! We played a total of 5 matches during the day. Our human player, Paul, is leading in points for noodle throwing for the day. Also, the team is currently ranked number 9 out of 102 teams. Tomorrow, opening ceremonies begin at 9:00 am and matches begin at 9:30 am. Lunch will be around noon and the competition will continue at 1:00 pm and go until 8:00 pm. Our business team is scheduled to present for The Engineering Inspiration Award at 1:20 pm, and we wish them the best of luck! Hope to see you all in the stands cheering us on this weekend!
