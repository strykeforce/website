<p>In the midst of the current season, out team is already looking forward into plans for next year. This includes initializing our recruiting system. Stryke Force will be having an open house on May 16th, 17th, and 18th from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Both middle and high school students are welcome at this event. Make sure to spread the word to any interested students, and mark it in your calendar. During these days, Stryke Force members will come into Midlink and explain what Stryke Force does, and showing them around our build space. It promises to be a fun and successful event where we can show people how awesome Stryke Force is. If you are a student interested in joining the team sign up <a href="http://strykeforce.org/new-members/" target="_blank">here</a> to receive more information about how to join.</p>
