Now a freshman on the high school team, Jack will be driving the FRC robot in the 2016 season. He’s already had a chance to drive at the WMRI, assisting the team in their victory. FTC has done a good job of preparing Jack for driving in high school. He already has a lot experience with strategizing, as well as how to form strong alliances. Here’s what Jack feels is different driving for FRC compared to FTC.</span></p>

The swerve drive makes the robot much more maneuverable. </span></p>
<p id="yiv7047802264yui_3_16_0_1_1447692389116_9175" class="yiv7047802264" dir="ltr"><span id="yiv7047802264yui_3_16_0_1_1447692389116_9177" class="yiv7047802264">The field is a lot larger, having more space to maneuver the robot makes driving a bit easier. But along with a larger field comes a larger robot, although this doesn’t make much of a difference for driving, it can cause visibility issues when a robot drives in front of the driver station. </span></p>
<p id="yiv7047802264yui_3_16_0_1_1447692389116_9179" class="yiv7047802264" dir="ltr"><span id="yiv7047802264yui_3_16_0_1_1447692389116_9181" class="yiv7047802264">In FTC there are only two teams per alliance, resulting in a total of four robots on the field at a time. With three teams on each alliance, driving for FRC means that there are more robots that could get in the way. This is why communication with your other alliance members is very important. </span></p>

There is a strong possibility that we will be facing that once again  in the 2016 game. With just a bit of experience with defense in FTC, Jack is preparing himself for defense next spring. </span></p>
