With the end of the first week of build season coming up, a Stryke Force alumni has provided some advice for the current members. ![100_0714](/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/100_0714.jpg) "As the season kicks into high gear, balancing school with robotics can be difficult, especially with a game as awesome as Stronghold. In order to manage your time, come up with a strategy. Many classes have weekly or even daily homework that can be predictable - this lends itself to easy scheduling. Set aside time each day to do the daily and weekly homework, but make sure to keep some free time for unexpected work or long term projects. During competition season, plan ahead. Talk to teachers and find out what you will be missing on competition days, then come up with a plan on how and when you will complete the work. Car rides are great for doing homework, as are free days on weekends." -Katherine, Class of 2014, Purdue University
