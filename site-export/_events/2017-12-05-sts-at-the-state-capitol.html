<p>Stryke Force Robotics team 2767 will be traveling with their World Championship robot to the Lansing this week for the Student Technology Showcase hosted by <a href="http://sts.macul.org/">MACUL</a>.&nbsp;Stryke Force members will be in their pit with the robot from 11:30am - 1pm in the South Wing of the Michigan State Capitol Building at Table 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>The showcase is a day-long event held in the Michigan State Capitol Building to allow lawmakers, business leaders and other citizens to see first-hand how technology is used in classrooms across Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp;K-12 student teams representing their&nbsp;schools from around the state will&nbsp;demonstrate best practices of how technology can enhance teaching and learning for the success of Michigan students.&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
