# Open House Reminder and Team Party Recap!

This past Sunday was our annual team party hosted by one of our mentors. It was a great time! The students all had so much fun playing Bocce Ball, cards, and sword fighting in the annual game of capture the flag. We had delicious food and were surrounded by wonderful friends and family. Don't forget to come to any of our open houses on May 11, 12, and 13 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. All students grades 6-12 are welcome, and family and friends are encouraged to come as well! Our team has 3 sides, build, business, and programming, and no previous experience is required. All you need to come with is an interest and excitement for robotics, marketing, programming, web design or anything else in between! Our space is located at Midlink Business Park, 5200 E Cork St in Kalamazoo, and just follow the yellow signs to our door. If you have any questions, you can use the "contact" tab on the main menu of the website. We hope to see you all there!
