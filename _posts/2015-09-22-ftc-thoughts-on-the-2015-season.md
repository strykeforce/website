(Yay!) The Java programming will be difficult as it is a new language this season."

I'm excited to apply last year's skills to new things in this game. I'm looking forward to the competition."

I found it confusing at first but after I read the rules it made more sense. I'm excited about learning more programming. Along with math, science and engineering, I've learned a lot about the game and what to expect at competitions."

I'm looking forward to the competition and seeing the robots other teams build. I've learned that if you drop a ball in a bucket there's a 50% chance it will bounce back out."

I'm excited to see if the robot does everything we've designed it to do. One of the things I've learned so far is how to put a wheel on a robot."
