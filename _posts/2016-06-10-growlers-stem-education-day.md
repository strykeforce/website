# Growlers STEM Education Day

On Tuesday, June 7, we participated in our second annual Growlers STEM Education Day. This was a great opportunity for us to spread FIRST into our community and teach younger students about STEM. Despite the drizzling rain we had a great time showing off our FRC and FTC robots to elementary schools from around Kalamazoo County. Students were given the chance to drive the FTC robot and catch and return the balls to the FRC robot. There’s nothing our team loves more than to inspire young kids to pursue STEM.
