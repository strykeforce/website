<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a fabulous load in night at the State Championship! When we arrived we unloaded the robot and set up the pit. Throughout the night we answered other team's scouting questions and lent out tools to teams in need. We were able to run 3 practice matches tonight. Our performance got better with each match, giving us high hopes for the competition tomorrow! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p>A highlight of the night was celebrating one of our coach's birthday!</p>
