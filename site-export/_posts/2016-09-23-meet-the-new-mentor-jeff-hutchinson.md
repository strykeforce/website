<div>My name is Jeff Hutchison.  I recently joined the Stryke Force Robotics team as a programming mentor upon my retirement from Stryker.  I learned about this team from Jerry Culp, a former co-worker.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>I was recruited by Stryker after graduating from the University of Colorado in electrical and computer engineering and a 5 year commitment with the U. S. Navy.  During my Stryker career I worked in engineering, information technology, management and strategic planning.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>I am passionate about education and specifically STEM for today's youth.  I am also a community volunteer with several not-for-profit organizations in Kalamazoo.  Other pastimes include grilling, traveling, music, spending time with family and any outdoor activity.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>It’s great that the Stryke Force software development team has members with a wide range of programming experience. I split my time between teaching new developers and working with the more experienced team members. With the help of the build team, we’re developing a training robot that will give us a fun way to learn robotics software development before the build season starts. I’m really looking forward to the whole software team pitching in during the build season to help build a winning robot!</div>
