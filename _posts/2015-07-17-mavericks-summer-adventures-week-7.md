A little bit of rain won't keep Maverick from enjoying his summer! Can you guess where he went adventuring this week? Comment your guess and check in [next week](/2015/07/24/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-8/) to see if you were correct! This summer Maverick is going on vacation to tour Kalamazoo with his Stryke Force friends. We'll be posting pictures of his adventures each week, so be sure to look for them!
