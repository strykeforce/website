<p>Where in the World is Stryke Force?</p>
<p>The FTC students took their robot for a walk in the park. Can anyone guess where they're at? Comment your guess and check in next week to see if you were correct!</p>
<p>Hint: The FRC robot visited the park at the other end of the trail <a href="http://strykeforce.org/2015/07/10/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-6/" target="_blank">last summer</a>.</p>
