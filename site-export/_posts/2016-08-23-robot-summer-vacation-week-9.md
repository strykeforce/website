<p>Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with.</p>
<p>McKenzie taught Robin Hood how to play lacrosse! He learned that his arm makes a great lacrosse stick if they play with the boulders! Who knows what other hidden talents Robin Hood might have?</p>
