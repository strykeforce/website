# Maverick's Summer Adventures - Week 13

School's almost back in session! Maverick had a great time touring this college campus. Can you guess where he's at? Comment your guess and check in [next week](/2015/09/03/mavericks-summer-adventures-week-14/) to see if you were correct! This summer Maverick is going on vacation to tour Kalamazoo with his Stryke Force friends. We'll be posting pictures of his adventures each week, so be sure to look for them!
