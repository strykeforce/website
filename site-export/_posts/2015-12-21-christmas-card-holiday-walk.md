<p>To celebrate the holiday season, the Stryke Force teams made Christmas card to put up at the celery flats Holiday walk. It was a fun, creative activity that everyone involved enjoyed. The end product was a super cute picture spreading holly jolly feelings. Here are a few pictures, but for the full experience, head over to celery flats to check it out!</p>
