<p>This year's game is called Recycle Rush! Below is a summary of the game, to find the full game manual go to http://contentviewer.adobe.com/s/FIRST/29d775cf-7df1-5bea-97a2-3309a6deda88/FRC2015GameManual/cover.html</p>
<p>Game Summary<br />
RECYCLE RUSH is a recycling-themed game designed for the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It is played by two Alliances of three<br />
Teams each. Alliances compete simultaneously to score points by stacking Totes on Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling<br />
Containers, and properly disposing of Litter, represented by pool noodles, in designated locations. In keeping with the recycling theme of the<br />
game, all scoring elements used are reusable or recyclable by teams in their home locations or by FIRST at the end of the season.<br />
The 27 ft. by 54 ft. playing Field is bisected by a small Step which may not be climbed on or crossed by Robots. Thus each Alliance competes<br />
on their respective 26 ft. by 27 ft. side of the Field.<br />
Each RECYCLE RUSH Match begins with a 15-second Autonomous Period in which Robots operate independently of their drivers. During this<br />
period, Robots attempt to move themselves, their Yellow Totes, and their Recycling Containers into the area between the scoring platforms,<br />
called the Auto Zone. Additional points are awarded if the Yellow Totes are arranged in a single stack. Points for this period are shown below</p>
<p>ROBOT SET - 4<br />
TOTE SET - 6<br />
CONTAINER SET - 8<br />
STACKED TOTE SET - 20</p>
<p>During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds of the Match, called the Teleop Period, Robots are controlled remotely by student drivers<br />
located behind the walls at the ends of the Field. Teams on an Alliance work together to place as many Totes on their Scoring Platforms as<br />
possible. Alliances earn additional points for Recycling Containers placed on the scored Totes, with Recycling Containers at greater heights<br />
earning more points.<br />
Alliances also earn points for disposing of their Litter in either their Landfill Zone (the area next to the Step marked by the white line) or placing<br />
Litter in or on scored Recycling Containers. Alliances that unscored leave Litter on their side of the Field at the end of the match add points to<br />
the score of the other Alliance, as it is considered unprocessed and not properly disposed of.</p>
