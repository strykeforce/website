<h3>FIRST ROBOTICS COMPETITION</h3>
<p>Did you know FIRST is an acronym? Its real title is “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THE FIRST ROBOTICS COMPETITION?</h3>
<p>”It is a unique varsity sport for the mind designed to help high-school-aged young people discover how interesting and rewarding the lives of engineers and scientists can be”. It has been growing steadily since 1992, when the First Robotics Competition only numbered 28 teams nationwide to over 2,400.</p>

<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
<p>“The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) stages short games played by robots. The robots are designed and built in six weeks (from a common set of parts) by a team of high-school-aged young people and a handful of engineers/Mentors. The students program and remotely control the robots in the competition rounds on the field”. Teams are formed in the fall. The kickoff for competition begins in early January and runs for the next 6-weeks which is called the “build” season. Competition starts in March and ends in April. “The FIRST Robotics Competition Regional events are typically held in university arenas. They involve 40 to 70 teams cheered by thousands of fans over three days.” The winners move on to a Championship event held in the Edward Jones Dome in St Louis, MO in the end of April.</p>
