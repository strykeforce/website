<p>Robin Hood had a great time playing Stronghold with all of his FRC friends last season! Now that the off-season has started he wants to try out the other activities his Stryke Force friends are involved with.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Stronghold Karley taught Robin Hood some archery. Robin Hood made his namesake proud, shooting arrows as well as he shoots boulders.</p>
