# State Competition Day 2

It was another amazing day at the FRC State Championship in Grand Rapids, where we stayed in the top of the rankings for the day. We started the morning in ninth place and slowly made our way up to first place with several matches scoring over two hundred points. Our human player, Paul, is once again at the top of the leader board for noodle points! And we are proud to say that we are currently ranked 20. While in the pits, where we work on the robot and communicate with judges as well as other competitors, we received many compliments on our robot’s appearance and application from teams throughout the state. It’s not only fulfilling for our team members to get positive feedback on our work, but to communicate and collaborate. Several instances of this include when we informed teams how we acquired our pit and additions to the robot design elements that set us apart. One particularly exciting event was meeting a team from Israel, and being able to talk about the differences and experiences we have had. Besides competing on the floor with the robot, we also were very busy scouting with 2 other teams, spending time in the pits talking to judges and presenting for the Engineering Inspiration Award. We also made adjustments to the robot, and of course cheered on our favorite team, Stryke Force!!! We can’t wait to see what tomorrow will bring for the final day of competition at the Deltaplex.  We’d love to see you there!  For more information and directions go to <http://www.firstinmichigan.org/FRC_2015/State_Championship/state_championship.html> [caption id="attachment_1650" align="alignnone" width="182"]![Lizzy and Andrew after the Engineering Inspiration Award Presentation](/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lizzy-and-Andrew.jpg) Lizzy and Andrew after the Engineering Inspiration Award Presentation[/caption] [caption id="attachment_1651" align="alignnone" width="191"]![Paul, Gabe and Theo!](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-boys.png) Paul, Gabe and Theo![/caption] [caption id="attachment_1652" align="alignnone" width="211"]![Talking with the team from Israel ](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-isreal-team.png) Talking with the team from Israel[/caption] [caption id="attachment_1653" align="alignnone" width="249"]![Team in the Pits!](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/In-the-pits.png) Team in the Pits![/caption]
