What a competition.  From the time our journey began in January we have planned, strategized, purchased parts, built, tested, rebuilt, wrote code, revised code and started our competitions.  We were thrilled when we qualified for States.  We finished the qualification matches at the State competition in 21st position out of 102 teams.  We were chosen by the 15th seed alliance to participate with them in the elimination rounds. The 16 alliances had a hard fought battle in the quarterfinals where our game play ended.  However, we went on to win the Imagery Award!

"The Imagery Award is given In honor of Jack Kamen, Dean Kamen's father, for his dedication to art and illustration and his devotion to _FIRST_. This award celebrates attractiveness in engineering and outstanding visual aesthetic integration of machine and team appearance."  Dean Kamen is the founder of FIRST Robotics and we are proud to receive this award!

The governor of Michigan paid the team a visit today in the pits, along with Fred Upton and Dean Kamen! It was such a pleasure to meet them and to have the governor sign the robot!

We also have good news and are pleased to tell you that our journey will continue. Stryke Force has qualified to compete in the FIRST World Championships in St. Louis April 22-25.  We have a lot to do to prepare for this trip coming in just a few short weeks.

We would like to thank our incredible mentors, sponsors, parents, and volunteers for an awesome season here in Michigan.  On to St. Louis!
