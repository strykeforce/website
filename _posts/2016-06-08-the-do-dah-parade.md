Team Stryke Force had an amazing time walking in the Do-Dah Parade this past Saturday. The parade was a fun way for the team to spend time with each other and showcase the accomplishments we’ve achieved this season. FRC and FTC students marched through the parade, spreading their enthusiasm for STEM to everyone at the event. As the robot shot balls into the tower, the crowd cheered with excitement and enthusiasm! The Do-Dah Parade allows Stryke Force to see first hand the effects of spreading FIRST into the Kalamazoo Community. Stryke Force thoroughly enjoys events such as this and looks forward to doing many more events within the community.
