# FTC Season Update

The FTC Season is in full swing!  The students have been busy constructing the practice field, planning their strategies, and building and testing their robots.   ![ftc-blog-4](/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ftc-blog-4-300x200.jpg) ![ftc-blog-3](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ftc-blog-3-300x200.jpg) ![ftc-blog-5](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ftc-blog-5-300x200.jpg) ![ftc-blog-2](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ftc-blog-2-300x200.jpg) ![ftc-blog-1](http://strykeforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ftc-blog-1-300x200.jpg)

Teams 7228 and 8553 are gearing up for competition season in December.  They will be competing in the Coloma Qualifier on 12/3 and the Concord Qualifier on 12/10.  They'd love for everyone to come out and cheer them on!
