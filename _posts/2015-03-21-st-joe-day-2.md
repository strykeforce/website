<p>What a great day of competition!! We had the high score in 7 out of our 9 matches, and we finished in 5th place at the end of the day! Our human player had the highest litter points of the day with 278 noodle points, we beat the high score for tote points!</p>
<p>We also had our full scouting system up and running. Using the other teams' stats we will be able to pick our alliance for the finals tomorrow.</p>
<p>Along with the robot competition, there's also awards that can be won. Today our business team presented to the judges for the Chairman's Award, the most prestigious award at the competition. We also had build and business students in the pits. They were showing off the robot, as well as discussing the business aspects of our team. One of our students was nominated by the mentors for the Dean's List Award, and she had her interview with the judges today.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic day with tons of cheering and dancing! Thank you to all of our fabulous fans who cheered us on all day long!! We'll see you all tomorrow!</p>
