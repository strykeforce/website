<p>The "Stop building day" or as the Stryke Force team calls it, "Bag Night", took place on February 17. On that day, all teams were required to stop work on their robots at midnight, and place the robot in a bag. One week before the teams' first competition, 6 hours are given to all teams, in which we can work on our robots. The time can be broken up into any amount of increments that we choose, as long as they are over 2 hours each. We are excited to show off the robot at our first competition in Kentwood this Friday and Saturday, and we hope to see you all in the stands!</p>
