# Competition Update- Day 3!

Today was the last day of our first competition of the season! We are so thankful to all of our great supporters who cheered us on from the stands, and all of our sponsors who have believed in us throughout the season. We stayed at the top of the rankings all day, and ended the qualification matches in 4th seed. The team made it to the quarter finals and we also won the Imagery Award for our creative image of the team, robot, and this years theme of "Rosie The Riveter." This weekend was very exciting and we learned so much. We can't wait for our next competition in St.Joe, just 2 weeks from now, March 20-21! It was a great competition and was so much fun, thanks to all of our amazing supporters.  And a big thank you to our Stryke Force team members who were FIRST volunteers this weekend!
