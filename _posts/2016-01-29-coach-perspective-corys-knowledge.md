# Coach Perspective: Cory's Knowledge

Stryke Force would not be where it is today without the help and support of our amazing mentors and coaches. In order to learn more about these supportive people, I asked Cory Walters, Stryke Force Co-Coach, about his experiences with FIRST. What's the best thing about being a coach? I enjoy seeing the students develop from the time they first come in to the FIRST community to the time they leave. They gain a lot of new skills and grow to become better people. How did you become a coach? I knew Kim (head coach of Stryke Force)  before I moved to Kalamazoo, my former robotics team that I mentored had an alliance with Stryke Force during a competition, so when I moved here, I knew it was a good team, so I got involved. What is something that is different this year as opposed to previous years? I feel like the process is getting much smoother. Every year we gain more knowledge, so the whole season is going easier than before. What is one of your favorite memories of Stryke Force? I don't think I have one specific memory that I like better than others, but there is something that's happened repeatedly that I love. Every year, when we go to the World Championship, I really enjoy just seeing all of the people in the stands who are so enthusiastic about STEM and the new generation of leaders. That gives me a great feeling.   Stryke Force is absolutely lucky to have people like Cory with real life experiences in the STEM world who can not only teach how to handle a drill or come up with a game strategy, they also are role models and genuine friends to the kids on the team. Thank you, Coaches and Mentors!
