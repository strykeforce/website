Hello Stryke Force friends, family, sponsors, and supporters! As you know last weekend we had our first competition of the year in Kentwood. My name is Emma Scheller and I’ll be sharing my personal experience with the event. I’m a sophomore at Gull Lake High School and Kalamazoo Area Math and  Science Center and the 2015 season is my first year on the robotics team. We have a lot of rookies on our team this year (myself among them) and seeing all of our hard work pay off, was really a rewarding experience. It really makes you thankful to be part of such a great program like FIRST and such a great team like Stryke Force!

Even if you aren’t in the pits at competition, everyone has an important role. I like to help everyone get excited and show our team spirit, because even if our robot isn’t always successful, there are many  lessons to be learned from being a good team member. Winning awards is pretty great too. The Imagery Award was an awesome surprise that shows just how cohesive of a presence our team has become. It reminds us that everyone gathers for these competitions to have fun. We are having a great time as well as learning and accomplishing tasks. That’s pretty great. As for getting my team to line dance with me…. Well I’m offering lessons Monday! Next weekend, on March 20th and March 21st we will be competing in St. Joe! That will be another great adventure for Stryke Force to take on, and we encourage you to attend! I can personally assure you it’ll be a great experience!
