<p>FIRST Relic Recovery is played on a 3.7m × 3.7m (12 ft. × 12 ft.) square field with approximately 0.3m (1 ft.) high walls and a soft foam mat floor. The field has two red and two blue balancing stones are mounted on the field floor. Four relics are placed in corners, four jewel sets and four cryptoboxes are located on the field walls.&nbsp; In the center of the field is a glyph pit and 48 6" square foam glyphs are randomly placed inside the glyph pit.&nbsp; Red and Blue relic recovery zones extend outside of the field.</p>
<p>At the start of a match, each alliance has one glyph available for preloading and is balanced on its alliance balancing stone. Matches have two distinct periods of play: a 30-second Autonomous period followed by a two-minute Driver Controlled period, the last 30 seconds of the Driver Controlled period is called the End Game which adds new scoring opportunities for robots to achieve.</p>
